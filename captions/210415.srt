1
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:09,040
OK, recording should be under way for the first

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,610
few minutes, at least, we will hopefully see some

3
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:18,880
more folks trickling in, but. In the meantime, can

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,260
get set up with the usual opening bid, checking to

5
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:29,200
see if there are. Any questions from you about

6
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:33,430
anything that has come up in the module so far

7
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:41,820
and. Leave. This question, this poll up and

8
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:47,870
running for a few minutes while. More people come

9
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:51,980
on in and in the meantime, I can give a few

10
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:58,940
comments on. Logistical matters now that we have

11
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:02,870
the end of the term in sight, so the computer

12
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:07,760
project, obviously, you all know, was due about 36

13
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,200
hours ago, and I suspect that some of you all were

14
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:17,240
focused on that to the extent that you're too

15
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:22,070
tired to have to come in for the synchronous

16
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:28,130
session today. But keeping things moving, the the

17
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:31,250
very final piece of continuous assessment, the

18
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:38,510
last homework assignment is up and available. And

19
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:44,380
it has three questions. One corresponding to a

20
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:49,640
week for an ideal gas's, looking at what happens

21
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,960
when two ideal devices are mixed in a in the same

22
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:58,880
container. The question on the week five material

23
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,360
with thermodynamic cycles going through

24
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:06,470
calculations for that and then question on the

25
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:11,660
green canonical ensemble for week six. And as I

26
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:15,890
suspect you all know well, it's worthwhile to just

27
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:19,550
take a quick read through those problems right

28
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:22,430
away, have them percolating in the back of your

29
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:26,800
mind. Over the next few days, even before you get

30
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,190
around to having the time and inclination to

31
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:34,120
really work on that final assignment, its due end

32
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,670
of Tuesday, the 27th, that'll be the end of

33
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:42,400
continuous assessment for this module insight and.

34
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:52,540
You can see in the meantime or next week, rather,

35
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:55,890
if questions about it come up, they can go onto

36
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,560
canvas sites or

37
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,540
be brought up at synchronous sessions over the

38
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:10,480
next 10 days. Also, I have taken care of the issue

39
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,990
that came up Monday that the last year's exam was

40
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:17,290
not in the repository, just turned out to be due

41
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:21,400
to an oversight following from the strange

42
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,110
situation last year that should now be corrected.

43
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:29,170
And both that exam and a sample exam are also

44
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,280
uploaded to the candidate site with more sample

45
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,170
problems to come now that the assessed assignments

46
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:40,960
are running their course.

47
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:43,790
And I.

48
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,870
Did I realize on Monday that for some reason there

49
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:57,170
was a question that came in through people

50
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,960
everywhere, that whatever reason did not appear on

51
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,170
my screen until after the end of the synchronous

52
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:07,040
session? Just a quick clarification about that

53
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,510
computer project that was cleared up in the

54
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,690
subsequent office hours on trying to make sure

55
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:15,800
that this was something similar does not happen

56
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:21,080
this time around, making sure that there are

57
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:24,320
opportunities or any questions that come in

58
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,850
through all everywhere. I see. Before moving on.

59
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:34,640
And if I do move on too quickly, as always, feel

60
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,880
free to wonder yourself and speak up, grab my

61
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:43,490
attention or puts a comment in the chat window

62
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:49,700
just to make sure that I don't overlook anything

63
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,070
accidentally before moving on.

64
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:07,580
But having. Taken some due diligence to try to

65
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,800
avoid that issue this time around, we can

66
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:15,290
dive back into to where we were or where we got to

67
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:19,460
on Monday after reviewing the skeleton of the

68
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:24,740
molecule that that we saw up to the break, the

69
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,810
three different kinds of ensembles we were looking

70
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:33,260
at quantum statistics and the. Distinction between

71
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:37,700
quantum statistics and classical statistics in

72
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:41,630
reviewing the concept of quantized energy levels,

73
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:45,880
which we saw all the way back in Chapter four per

74
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,300
week for material on the classical ideal gas, we

75
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:54,830
had to propose that energy levels were quantized

76
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:59,810
in order to have a well-defined, partitioned

77
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:03,290
function, something over a countable, if infinite

78
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:04,760
number of microstates.

79
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:13,320
And. That is a necessary but not sufficient

80
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:17,910
ingredient to really define quantum statistics in

81
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:20,970
contrast to the classical statistics. The key

82
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:24,360
distinction is shown on the screen here, the

83
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:29,160
shaded box in the asynchronous materials for this

84
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:36,210
week, which is providing or making a conceptual

85
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:38,310
point that may be subtle and may be worth

86
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:41,340
illustrating with some examples and exercises.

87
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:49,240
Where in the classical approach. We consider. Each

88
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,780
individual particle in our system, which may be

89
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,480
fixed in the canonical ensemble and may be

90
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,910
fluctuating from microstates to microstates in the

91
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:00,730
grand canonical ensemble, but for each of those

92
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:05,560
particles in the total number, we sum over all of

93
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,410
the possible energies that we can have and then

94
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:11,560
correct for any overcounting in the case of

95
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,590
indistinguishable particles, that is relevant for

96
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:18,010
quantum mechanics. And again, you don't need to

97
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:21,550
know anything about quantum mechanics as a

98
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:25,240
scientific discipline. This is all just

99
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,810
conjectures or assumptions that we are making to

100
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:31,660
provide interesting systems to study that we can

101
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:39,490
connect to real world phenomena. And that approach

102
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:45,420
turns out to breakdown if there are. Or if there

103
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:50,040
is a non-negative a non negligible probability

104
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:53,580
that multiple particles may be occupying the same

105
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:57,540
energy level and in that case, which defines the

106
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:00,120
quantum regime, we have to take a different

107
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:04,170
approach looking at quantum statistics where

108
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,140
instead of sending over the particles and then

109
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:10,140
their energies, we sum over the possible energy

110
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:14,460
levels and all of the possible occupation numbers

111
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:17,160
that each of those energy levels could have. So

112
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:22,080
just to what I have planned for some activities

113
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:27,090
today is checking in quickly with a couple of the

114
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,690
big gaps in the notes just to make sure we're all

115
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:33,840
on the same page with those and then do something

116
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:38,310
a bit more interesting, extending that example or

117
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:43,410
that illustration just to make sure that the

118
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:48,900
procedure we followed in these notes is clear to

119
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:53,550
everyone. So let's move on to the first of those

120
00:08:54,690 --> 00:09:01,770
quick check ins, which is touching on the Gap on

121
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:04,530
page ninety four, where we look at a extremely

122
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:09,480
simple example where this contrast between

123
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,690
classical and quantum statistics is.

124
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:20,740
Easy to see is is obvious, possibly too simplified,

125
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:26,470
it becomes maybe a bit too obvious to have its

126
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:30,190
full importance clear. But the idea is

127
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,400
we consider a canonical system with just two

128
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:40,420
particles, each of which can occupy any of five

129
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:45,130
energy levels. And we want to sum over all of the

130
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:52,420
microstates in this system where in the in the

131
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:56,200
classical approach that defines the two particle

132
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,320
canonical partition function for the case where

133
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,750
the particles are distinguishable with some over

134
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:05,380
both of those particles and just add up all of the

135
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:09,670
possible energy levels that they could be in. And

136
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:13,660
that gives a prediction here for the number of

137
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:17,140
microstates which we have gone through some

138
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:21,550
manipulations to make equal to the total canonical

139
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:24,040
partition function in this case,

140
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:31,090
which is. What's running in the poll here, two

141
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:37,520
particles filling. In year five, energy levels

142
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:41,870
define some level, some number of microstates that

143
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:45,290
have to be sold over to determine the partition

144
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:45,830
function.

145
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:07,050
And given the small crowd today, I won't wait too

146
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:11,800
long for responses if they don't come. In a minute

147
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,740
or two, they may not be coming at all, but

148
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:21,340
hopefully we'll be able to check in and confirm

149
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:25,540
that at least the material material and the

150
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:29,740
written notes that you've had to look at this week

151
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:33,910
is sufficiently straightforward to answer this

152
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:40,220
question. And if it is not? You feel free to to

153
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:47,600
say so, and we can. Go through it in L.A. rather

154
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,530
than on page.

155
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:37,110
So I'll make a last call for any further responses

156
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:49,050
in. Go on to see. We have in. The. Results here

157
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:50,190
where?

158
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:59,620
There's unanimous agreement that. There are five

159
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:02,140
possible energy levels for each of two particles

160
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:07,360
gives five squared or 25 microstates where going

161
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,350
back to the notes then.

162
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:13,070
We see that in the indistinguishable case,

163
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:17,640
appropriate for. Quantum particles, this classical

164
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,860
approach tells us that.

165
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:27,490
We should expect to count, you know.

166
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:35,720
That distinguishable canonical partition function,

167
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:39,650
twenty five over two is twelve point five

168
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:45,210
microstates, which is nonsense because the micro

169
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:48,500
the micro states that we are sitting over are by

170
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:53,270
definition, integers. So that is the simplest

171
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:58,310
possible example of what goes wrong with. The

172
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:01,520
classical approach to.

173
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:08,420
Two statistics, when there is a nonsexual

174
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:12,720
probability of having multiple particles in the

175
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:18,300
same energy level and if we explicitly go through

176
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:22,980
and count all of these twenty five.

177
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:27,500
Possible microstates that show up in that

178
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:29,390
distinguished distinguishable

179
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:35,620
particle, a canonical partition function. We see

180
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:41,380
that. Only those states where. All of the

181
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:44,740
particles are in different energy levels are

182
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:49,020
double counted, so once we. Switch from

183
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:51,120
distinguishable to indistinguishable particles.

184
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:56,490
This red and blue are both the same simple factor

185
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:59,550
of one count of the number of particles, and these

186
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:04,470
two states, those two microstates are identical

187
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:08,580
and overcounted in this approach. But this one

188
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:12,750
with both particles in a particular energy level

189
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,740
is not overcounted and should not be divided by

190
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:20,550
two, so it's only those 20.

191
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:26,720
That are divided by two in the indiscernible case

192
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:30,140
and the five where.

193
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:35,550
There are multiple particles in the same energy

194
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:40,740
level, do not pick up that overcounting factor, so.

195
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:44,100
In principle.

196
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:51,690
You can adapt classical statistics to try to keep

197
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:54,600
track of all of these different possible

198
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,700
overcounting factors, depending on.

199
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:03,630
Nice, just a note about your network.

200
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:10,700
Well, when we move on to the next project, I will,

201
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,990
yeah, read out the options and you can put them in

202
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,060
the chat window. We'll do what we can with the

203
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,400
network available to us.

204
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:28,710
As I was saying, well, it's possible to. Try to

205
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:33,000
keep track of all of the different possible

206
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,340
overcounting factors that could arise from

207
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,150
different multiplicities of particles in the same

208
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:41,710
energy states, really the quantum approach

209
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:46,020
mentioned earlier of counting occupation numbers.

210
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:51,210
Like these in each energy level, so each of the

211
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:55,320
numbers in these five, two lives is one of those

212
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,350
five energy levels. There are a maximum of two

213
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:02,640
particles total and just counting over all the

214
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:06,030
possible ways these particles can be distributed

215
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:09,060
into the energy levels. That's just counting.

216
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,390
Indistinguishable balls being placed in boxes and

217
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:17,900
immediately gives us these these 15.

218
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:27,670
The one other quick check in to do before diving

219
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:30,220
into something perhaps more interesting and

220
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:35,260
certainly more substantial. Is considering the two

221
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:40,130
possibilities for. The occupation numbers that

222
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:44,000
particles can have in quantum physics due to a.

223
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,860
Particular feature of quantum mechanics that we

224
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:54,100
won't go into in detail unless there is a request

225
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:57,940
for it. I guess this is your synchronous session,

226
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:01,990
so you should feel free to guide or directed to

227
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:05,140
your interests if those interests lie in the

228
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:09,810
direction of quantum mechanics. In nature, there

229
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:15,480
are all particles fall into these two distinct

230
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:19,260
classes called bosons and fermions are named after

231
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:22,470
a pair of 20th century physicists, those and

232
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:27,720
Fairmead that differ by the possible occupation

233
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:31,770
numbers that they can have in a given energy level.

234
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,890
In the case of those answers, maybe the familiar

235
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:38,490
one, because you can have any non-negative number

236
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:43,230
of particles in your energy level, just as we

237
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:46,260
would expect from every day. You can put as many

238
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:53,690
balls into a box as is fit in there. For me, the

239
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:55,970
Fermín case or the case of Ferme Dirac's

240
00:18:55,970 --> 00:19:03,960
assistants is maybe less familiar. And for those

241
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:08,640
particles, it is possible to have at most a single

242
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,970
particle in each energy level, so the possible

243
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:16,470
occupation numbers are only zero and one as

244
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:20,090
opposed to all non-negative integers or bosons.

245
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:24,730
And this leads to. Different counting of those

246
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:30,040
occupation numbers and hence. Going over the some

247
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:33,470
over microstates in the quantum approach to

248
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:36,550
partition functions, we end up with different

249
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:41,510
statistics. Where the quick the second quick check

250
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:44,540
in today here is filling in this box on page

251
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:46,010
ninety six.

252
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:54,500
Counting that out of those micro states for the

253
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:59,030
two particle, five local example we were looking

254
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:05,240
at a few minutes ago, how many of them? Are valid

255
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:11,540
for fermions as opposed to the bosun's or or the

256
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:13,010
classical particles that.

257
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:22,170
Do not. Feel the effect of quantum mechanics. And.

258
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:27,770
If the options are still loading that equation,

259
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:31,490
you can just number them at A equals five

260
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:35,690
microstates, B is 10 microstates C is 15 and B is

261
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:39,230
twenty five. In that response can just come in the

262
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:43,040
chat window either directly to me or publicly to

263
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:44,370
to everyone.

264
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:53,390
And in the spirit of a quick check in, this is the

265
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,140
last call for your responses, and there's that

266
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:01,400
link again, in case those of you who joined since

267
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,050
it was last posted in the chat window.

268
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,550
I just see that.

269
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,790
Going back and opening up the.

270
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:24,200
Appropriate response. There is again. Unanimity

271
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:28,160
that looks like no problems with.

272
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,760
Those two quick check ins going back up to the

273
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:37,880
comprehensive list that we had here,

274
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,290
these are the 15 microstates for boatswain's and.

275
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,210
We're fermions we cannot have.

276
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:58,140
The the five with that definitely occupy the

277
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:05,960
energy level, only the 10. Remain with singly

278
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:10,920
occupy energy levels. In the case of fermions.

279
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,050
So.

280
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:24,330
Still a little. Bit longer. Calculation, just to

281
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,010
make sure that.

282
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:32,070
Make sure that this example was not. Too trivial

283
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:37,590
to to reveal the mathematics that's going on and

284
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:39,750
that things can be.

285
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:50,400
Reid arrived in. New cases. So do that same sort

286
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:55,870
of exercise, but instead of. Two particles with

287
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:59,990
access to. Five energy levels.

288
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:07,890
It's everywhere responds to.

289
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:14,550
There it is, things are updated, so a bit longer

290
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:17,490
calculation they'll give you we'll check in after

291
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:21,440
five minutes to work on this on your own. You'll

292
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:25,170
go through a bit of setup just now. We'll crank up

293
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:28,920
the number of energy levels and crank up the

294
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:33,670
number of particles. So. Consider three particles

295
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:37,210
and seven energy levels to a generalization of the

296
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:42,040
calculation. You've had a week to look at and the

297
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:46,540
question is how many microstates are there for

298
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:49,150
fermions and for bosun's in this case? This is

299
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:53,860
again, a small enough system. That's the classical

300
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:58,810
accounting is is clearly wrong, sending over each

301
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:02,710
of those three particles, looking at the seven

302
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:05,290
states that could be in and multiplying all of

303
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:08,020
those together to get a seven cubed and then

304
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:10,480
dividing by that three factorial overcounting

305
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,200
factor again gives a non integer number of

306
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:20,240
microstates. In the correct quantum approach of

307
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:23,870
sending over energy levels and occupation numbers

308
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:29,570
is required in order to. Correctly count the

309
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:32,360
microstates being some day over to determine the

310
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:35,870
partition function. And from there, all of the

311
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:37,160
properties of the system.

312
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:46,180
And that will also differ. For the case of those

313
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:49,570
vs. fermions, due to the difference, possible

314
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:51,370
occupation numbers that they can have.

315
00:25:56,790 --> 00:26:00,840
So I'll give you several minutes to. Work through

316
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:04,170
that calculation and keep an eye on responses as

317
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:07,080
they come in and feel free to.

318
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:16,190
Ask any questions. Out loud in writing, as you

319
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:21,410
prefer, if you get stuck or don't know where to to

320
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,480
start with this. Calculation.

321
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:35,980
And I see responses coming in. So. Me. Ask if

322
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:39,460
anyone is still working and wants more time.

323
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,080
If I don't.

324
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:45,410
S..

325
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:53,000
The hand over here response and will start to.

326
00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:58,380
Transition to.

327
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:03,860
Taking a look at what we have.

328
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:35,150
And. And there's not quite unanimity, so perhaps

329
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:35,750
it's worth.

330
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:38,830
Is reviewing.

331
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:48,100
Reviewing quickly how the calculation would

332
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:52,500
proceed for First-Floor Fermions and then for

333
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:58,060
boatswain's, and here is a bit of like space in

334
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:01,960
the margin where I can try to draw.

335
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,560
Seven boxes.

336
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,030
And we can think about.

337
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:17,060
The way is that three particles can be placed in

338
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:21,920
here first in the case of fermions, where you can

339
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:26,990
have at most a single particle in each box, so

340
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:31,040
there are seven options to choose from for that

341
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:34,490
location of that first particle, vector seven. But

342
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:40,680
now no more fermions can go in. That, first of all,

343
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:45,600
there are only six possibilities for the location

344
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:49,710
of the second Permian and similarly five for the

345
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:53,520
location of the third, and since each of these.

346
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:57,770
Particle's is in a different energy level. We

347
00:31:57,770 --> 00:32:02,750
still do have that full overcounting factor of

348
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:08,300
three. Factorial, which equals six, and we end up

349
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:11,480
with seven times five, is thirty five.

350
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:20,700
Whereas for. The case of bosoms, we still have

351
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:26,910
those 35 contributions where each of the particles

352
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:30,180
is in a different energy level, but now there is.

353
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:35,240
The option of having to particle's.

354
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:39,130
In the same energy level.

355
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:42,870
Like so.

356
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:48,420
So seven places where those two particles could be

357
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:50,100
put in then.

358
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:56,860
Six possibilities for the third particle divided

359
00:32:56,860 --> 00:33:01,990
by that overcounting factor of two factorial. It

360
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:06,490
seven times three is twenty one, and then finally

361
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:13,320
the. Third option is where? All three particles

362
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,460
are in.

363
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:22,950
That same energy level for the Bozena case. And

364
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:27,210
that is a final. Factor of seven.

365
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:29,720
So.

366
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:39,380
The fermions are fully described by the 35 to the

367
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:44,590
left for those we have to sum over. All three of

368
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:47,320
these positive contributions, twenty five plus

369
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:53,350
thirty five plus twenty eight is fifty sixty three.

370
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:00,840
It is written down here, 60 to.

371
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:08,920
Of. Just so that I don't have to do the addition

372
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:11,800
in my head, and that is the way that these sorts

373
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,530
of calculations have to go when we are in the

374
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:19,340
canonical ensemble where. The.

375
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:26,560
Or the number of particles is fixed and there is

376
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:30,760
then a constraint over how many total particles we

377
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:34,930
can have maximum in order to add up to the fixed

378
00:34:34,930 --> 00:34:37,090
number of particles in the canonical ensemble.

379
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:43,030
This example also illustrates why. It is a bit

380
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:47,630
easier to to work in the green canonical example,

381
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:52,490
in the case of quantum statistics, which is the.

382
00:34:54,100 --> 00:35:00,530
Exercise that. Or the the poll that is should now

383
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:03,290
be up and running.

384
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:10,970
Where? By going through this exercise, we can see

385
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:16,150
that just from the options, the. The combinatorics,

386
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:18,790
the mathematics of counting possible microstates

387
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:23,660
is. Significantly simplified when the number of

388
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:26,830
particles is allowed to fluctuate in the grand

389
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:30,290
canonical approach rather than being fixed in the

390
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:35,100
canonical approach. So that is motivation for.

391
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:40,870
Tackling these quantum systems over the next

392
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:43,390
couple of weeks in the grand canonical ensemble,

393
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:49,420
it will simplify the mathematics and I'll just

394
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:54,190
give you a minute or two to respond to this,

395
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:57,550
hopefully having gone through the more complicated

396
00:35:57,550 --> 00:36:02,080
canonical calculation for the same system with

397
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,280
seven energy levels.

398
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:08,750
Keeping an eye on how quickly the responses come

399
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:12,770
in and move on once we reach a critical mass.

400
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:25,970
Looking at these.

401
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:32,010
Responses, I may have made a mistake setting

402
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:34,380
things up, see?

403
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:59,230
Indeed, I did. So let's well, let me have. You can

404
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:05,660
see the answer looking at. Me correcting the tape

405
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:10,690
and I put in here, which was a copy paste. Being

406
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:15,430
too quick with the copying and pasting that again,

407
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:16,180
we want to.

408
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:23,750
Some over now, all of these. Possible energy

409
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:29,390
levels for any number of particles zooming in on

410
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:34,730
the thermionic case. And hopefully getting the

411
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:37,250
ability to wake up and respond.

412
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:48,380
Not sure why the screen share here is getting a

413
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:50,960
bit. Slakey.

414
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:02,580
We can have microstates with no particle's. We're

415
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:08,090
up one particle in each of these boxes for the

416
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:09,050
Fermoy on a case.

417
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:15,390
So we have two options for each of seven boxes.

418
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:23,610
So in total, there should be. Those two options

419
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:28,830
for each of the seven boxes is what is that, two

420
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:32,880
four eight 16, 32, sixty four one twenty eight,

421
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:36,270
which I mistakenly entered as the the opposite

422
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:39,990
order, seven squared. I will correct that live and

423
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:44,510
apologize for the added.

424
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:50,780
Apologize for the typo and the corresponding

425
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:54,680
confusion that we've now seen the answer, where

426
00:39:55,610 --> 00:39:56,150
were the.

427
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:03,380
The Bozak case, everyone did say that there are

428
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:08,970
possibly infinite number of. Of those islands that

429
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:17,480
we can have. So. I think you all are.

430
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:33,000
We are demonstrating the solid grasp of both the

431
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:36,180
quantum physics concept of something over these

432
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:39,210
energy levels, as well as the distinction between

433
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:44,260
bosons and fermions. And in the grand economic

434
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:48,950
approach that. That we are now taking for the next

435
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:53,930
few weeks these. Sums over the microstates, giving

436
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:57,410
us the grand canonical partition function take

437
00:40:57,410 --> 00:41:03,440
particularly simple forms, and that is largely

438
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,690
thanks to the fact that we are still.

439
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,720
Considering these not interacting systems where

440
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:13,520
each of the particles

441
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:18,440
does not interact with any of the other particles,

442
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:22,820
and even though we are something over occupation

443
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:24,800
numbers of particle levels rather than a single

444
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:29,190
particle, energy states this. Ideal, not

445
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:32,820
attracting nature of the systems is still showing

446
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:37,590
up in the way that the calculations break apart

447
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:38,280
into.

448
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:45,810
Multiple identical factors. Essentially one for

449
00:41:45,810 --> 00:41:49,590
each of these not interacting particles, so.

450
00:41:55,170 --> 00:41:59,210
Going through both the. The Bose Einstein

451
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:01,780
statistics for biosolids of the family, direct

452
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:06,440
statistics for fermions, we are able to get

453
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:11,890
results that. End up in the form of this product

454
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:16,960
over many identical factors, one for each energy

455
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:17,400
level,

456
00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:22,570
and that is a.

457
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:28,880
An example of behavior known as factorization,

458
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:33,170
which is also something we saw in week four

459
00:42:33,170 --> 00:42:37,580
material on the classical ideal gas, where the

460
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:40,700
particle canonical partition function was just

461
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:45,020
personal to Ann Powers of the single particle

462
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:48,990
partition function. Here in the case of quantum

463
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:53,550
statistics, we have a product over energy levels

464
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:56,730
rather than a product of a single particle

465
00:42:56,730 --> 00:42:59,520
petition functions. But in both cases there is

466
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:03,900
this factorization into multiple identical terms

467
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:06,540
that differ only by the relevant energy

468
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:11,010
corresponding to the energy level. And I mentioned

469
00:43:11,010 --> 00:43:15,450
this because in a few weeks we are going to set

470
00:43:15,450 --> 00:43:20,870
aside that assumption of non interacting. Ideal

471
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:24,380
behavior in these classes and start to see the

472
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:26,960
effects of interactions which are going to make

473
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:32,360
things much more complicated in a similar way to.

474
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:35,610
What we saw in the two parts of the computer

475
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:39,480
project where in the first part we had a simple

476
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:43,260
case where the Central Limit Theorem gave us all

477
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:46,590
of the answers right up front. But in the in the

478
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:49,470
second parts, when the central limit theorem was

479
00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:53,810
not applicable. We had to do a great deal more

480
00:43:53,810 --> 00:43:57,560
work and had to rely on numerical calculations to

481
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:01,670
get answers for the behavior of anomalous

482
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:05,390
diffusion. There will be a similar story for

483
00:44:05,390 --> 00:44:08,810
interacting systems where they are so much more

484
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:11,390
complicated than the ideal Das's of not

485
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:13,490
interacting particles that this sort of

486
00:44:13,490 --> 00:44:19,880
factorization. Will not be possible, and numerical

487
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:21,650
approaches will.

488
00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:26,690
We'll be necessary in order to get exact solutions

489
00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:32,960
and are very widely used in. Any realistic study

490
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:37,230
of of systems that. Systems of particles that

491
00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:42,740
interact with each other. In a non negotiable way.

492
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:51,180
And just in the last few minutes for today, I

493
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:54,810
won't pull up any more troops or polls, but just

494
00:44:54,810 --> 00:45:00,000
comment on the second possibly subtle conceptual

495
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,650
issue showing up in the the material for this week,

496
00:45:04,650 --> 00:45:05,280
which is

497
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:12,570
the. The high temperature limit in which these

498
00:45:12,570 --> 00:45:16,140
quantum physics should reproduce, the classical

499
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:18,870
behavior that we are familiar with from everyday

500
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:24,050
experience. Bringing in knowledge that quantum

501
00:45:24,050 --> 00:45:28,160
physics governs the microscopic world on the

502
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:33,860
atomic scale. We know that somehow these quantum

503
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:37,760
effects should not be visible in the larger scales

504
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:43,990
that we can directly see every day. And by looking

505
00:45:43,990 --> 00:45:47,980
back to our earlier work, we can appreciate that

506
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:52,150
it's high temperatures in these statistical

507
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:54,640
partition functions that correspond to the

508
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:57,580
classical limit of quantum statistics, and that is

509
00:45:57,580 --> 00:46:04,070
behavior. Illustrated in. This figure here where

510
00:46:04,070 --> 00:46:07,790
the high temperature limit is off to the right

511
00:46:07,790 --> 00:46:08,900
side of this flight.

512
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:19,990
Where both the. Classical Maxwell Bowsman

513
00:46:19,990 --> 00:46:24,160
statistics and the quantum Bose Einstein

514
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,530
statistics of Muslims attribute Iraq's statistics

515
00:46:26,530 --> 00:46:28,570
of fermions or.

516
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:38,210
Agree so well that it. Took us until. The 19th

517
00:46:38,210 --> 00:46:44,810
century to to really realize that. There were any

518
00:46:44,810 --> 00:46:49,010
subtleties coming from quantum behavior at lower

519
00:46:49,010 --> 00:46:54,320
energies, lower temperatures, really, and the

520
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:59,940
subtlety here is that. Looking at the quantity.

521
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:05,340
Plotted on the horizontal axis of this plot. It is

522
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:10,020
not immediately obvious that large temperatures

523
00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:13,440
correspond to large values of this ratio energy

524
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:16,380
minus chemical potential divided by temperature.

525
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:21,120
As the temperature gets large, that naively seems

526
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:25,830
to get small. But the key subtle issue is that in

527
00:47:25,830 --> 00:47:30,030
order to retain a finite number of particles,

528
00:47:30,330 --> 00:47:33,420
which is what is plotted on the vertical axis of

529
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:37,770
this thought, we need to take the chemical

530
00:47:37,770 --> 00:47:44,840
potential view off to negative infinity. As. The

531
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:47,230
temperature goes off to infinity to look at the

532
00:47:47,470 --> 00:47:51,760
high temperature classical limit. So that this

533
00:47:52,690 --> 00:48:00,280
ratio of minus you over to. Is much greater than

534
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:03,940
one, which is exactly the ratio here when those

535
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:07,750
energies are negligible and by much greater than

536
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:09,880
one, we see that already a factor of a few

537
00:48:10,270 --> 00:48:14,500
suffices to reproduce classical expectations from

538
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:16,570
quantum systems.

539
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:24,310
So. Depending on requests, we may revisit that

540
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:29,080
result and the calculations leading up to it in

541
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:32,050
more detail on Monday, you may just dive straight

542
00:48:32,050 --> 00:48:36,580
into more detail the considerations of quantum

543
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:43,050
gases of bosons. We'll see how we all feel in that

544
00:48:43,050 --> 00:48:45,300
synchronous session about how confident we are

545
00:48:45,870 --> 00:48:48,870
with the subtleties of the kind of statistics that

546
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:51,090
have been introduced this week. And of course, if

547
00:48:51,090 --> 00:48:54,270
you have immediate questions now, this is your

548
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:57,550
last chance to ask them during the second session.

549
00:48:57,570 --> 00:49:01,140
I'll be back in 10 minutes or so for office hours

550
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:05,220
once I shut down, zoom and extract that recording.

551
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:11,060
So that is all that I'm going to to say for today.
