1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:06,850
No. Hi, folks, and welcome back. And after the

2
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:07,610
term break.

3
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:14,570
Expecting or hoping that a few more people will

4
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:18,710
sign in over the next few minutes so they'll get

5
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:22,160
the recording started at the screen shared and

6
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:28,190
just start off with the usual pull for whether

7
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:34,580
there are any. Questions or issues that you would

8
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:38,870
like to. Bring up focus on discuss during this

9
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:45,500
secretive session before charging into some of the

10
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:52,490
logistics coming up and the. The new material on

11
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,090
quantum statistics and perhaps before getting into

12
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:58,180
the new stuff, it might be worthwhile to do a

13
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:02,380
recap or review of what came before the break

14
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:07,210
since it was a few weeks ago. Now that that break.

15
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:13,790
Kicked in some of the. Details may have slipped

16
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:19,240
away in the meantime, the. The.

17
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:26,920
Usual screening share set up and running.

18
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:37,550
Which should now be.

19
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:47,590
Visible and. Maybe the most timely matter is the

20
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,700
second parts of the computer project that is due

21
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:57,720
tomorrow. I have well, I've seen that some of you

22
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:01,320
have already submitted this over the past 10 days

23
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,220
or so, though there is still time for submissions,

24
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,560
if you see anything that.

25
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:13,830
Maybe suspicious or you would like to revise and

26
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:16,620
of course, there are many of you still working on

27
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:20,170
it and I have received questions about it from.

28
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:26,170
From a few of you and any further questions about

29
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:30,220
both about the assignment for the second part of

30
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:33,130
Self as well as for the solutions to the first

31
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:36,940
part that provide something of a template, a

32
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:41,740
similar exercise in the case where we had the

33
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:47,380
central limit theorem at hand to to provide an

34
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:51,220
analytic check of the numerical solutions, that is

35
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:55,780
all fair game for today is synchronous session.

36
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:59,290
And while I.

37
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:06,950
Wait to see if any. Questions of that sort come in.

38
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,910
Through that usual poll everywhere, a link in the

39
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:16,820
chat window. There it is again. For those of you

40
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:21,710
who have joined since it was first posted, I can

41
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:29,550
provide some general comments on. The first

42
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:33,600
homework assignments that got graded during the

43
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,740
break, so you all should have gotten the feedback

44
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:41,220
and solutions to that. So I can.

45
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:46,330
Show off in this screen.

46
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:55,370
And to begin with, maybe I will highlight the very

47
00:03:55,370 --> 00:04:00,050
last part of the third question is the one that

48
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:01,700
was

49
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:09,530
most consistently confusing for for several of you,

50
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:15,380
which was asking what are the conditions under

51
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:15,860
which?

52
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:24,550
This generic. Each capacity. Um.

53
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,960
Why you are not drawing, I don't know.

54
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,650
Something. Going on with the tablet there that now

55
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:39,440
seems to be resolved. So when is that heat

56
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,020
capacity and which takes the generic form of

57
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:45,860
energy fluctuations around the expectation value

58
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:50,060
of the energy, the conditions under which that can

59
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:56,210
equal zero and. The.

60
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:04,540
Common response that came into that question was

61
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,500
to say that, you know, we started off with the

62
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:09,570
heat capacity.

63
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:18,910
Equal to the derivative of that energy expectation

64
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:21,730
value with respect to the temperature. So it was

65
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:28,710
tempting to set that to zero and then. Say that E

66
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:30,250
had to be.

67
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:36,900
The constant in order for the capacity to vanish

68
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:41,760
in that is certainly a sufficient condition, but

69
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,790
it is not, in fact necessary. And this is a much

70
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:51,870
too severe a a condition to impose in order to get

71
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:58,500
the capacity to manage what we saw, just to review

72
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,540
the solutions. If you haven't looked at them

73
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:04,110
recently, all we have to do is recall the

74
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:09,330
definition of an expectation value as the sum over

75
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:13,320
microstates of the argument of that expectation

76
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:17,040
value in the annual brackets. And in this case,

77
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:22,650
that sum over microstates becomes the sum of a

78
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:26,040
strictly non-negative quantity, some quantity

79
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:31,450
squared. Multiplied by the probability that is

80
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:34,420
also not negative and we can take to be strictly

81
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:38,500
positive by saying that the sun is over, the

82
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,600
accessible micro states that have a non-zero

83
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,870
probability of actually appearing in the system.

84
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:51,460
So what we have is. A sum of strictly positive

85
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,860
squares with positive coefficients and the only

86
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:56,980
way that some can vanish is if each individual

87
00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:01,000
term vanishes individually, which gives us the

88
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,390
constraints on the energy for each individual

89
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:08,260
micro state. That has to be exactly equal to that

90
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,400
expectation value.

91
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,900
In other words, there are no possible fluctuations

92
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:19,220
of the energy around this particular value that

93
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:23,870
turns out then to be the expectation value is the

94
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,790
only possibility. So.

95
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:33,720
We can actually see this in action back. All the

96
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,520
way back in week three, actually, when we were

97
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:41,580
looking at a system of indistinguishable spins. So

98
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:45,340
spins in the solid that can wake up or down.

99
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,320
And pick up some energy from.

100
00:07:54,660 --> 00:08:00,120
Their interactions with external magnetic field. H.

101
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:07,790
Which. Age oriented in that direction, and we

102
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:12,740
computed. Back in those days before the break that.

103
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:17,500
The of the resulting energy for the system and

104
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,420
spins coming from that Helmholtz free energy was.

105
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:27,790
Minus beta, eight times the hyperbolic tangent.

106
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:35,070
A better age is the strength of the magnetic field,

107
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:39,420
beta is the inverse temperature. And therefore,

108
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:40,980
the heat capacity.

109
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:45,330
Resulting from this.

110
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:50,910
Is.

111
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:57,900
Try to remember the beta squared.

112
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:03,260
Debate The Times, this minus B, the age.

113
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,020
And then the.

114
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,990
Metabolic Vangent.

115
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:22,340
And if I can. Do this in my head or remember the

116
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:25,610
answer. Had the negative sides cancelling out and

117
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:27,530
then the two terms gave a.

118
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:40,610
Beta H squared over the hyperbolic cosine squared.

119
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:49,630
Of being age, which in the limit of. So we can do

120
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:53,440
the usual exercise of looking at the high and low

121
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:58,110
temperature limits of this function. At low

122
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:05,130
temperatures, so t going to zero. Are going to

123
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:10,470
infinity, the hyperbolic cosine diverges much more

124
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:15,210
quickly than Bureij squared, so that is one limit

125
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:19,790
in which the heat capacity goes to zero. Whereas

126
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:23,300
in the limit of infinite temperature where beta

127
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:27,530
goes to zero, hyperbolic, cosine goes to one, the

128
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:32,990
numerator also goes to zero in the way that in

129
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:35,240
that synchronous session we went through and

130
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:43,010
plotted here, this is I can't draw. On this screen,

131
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:45,800
but the vertical axis here is the heat capacity

132
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:49,100
for that system of indistinguishable spins and the

133
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:52,820
horizontal axis is Beda, the inverse temperature

134
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:54,740
so that.

135
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:59,950
The high temperature limit corresponds to the

136
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:04,840
small data where. Nobody goes to zero zero zero,

137
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:07,880
the capacity also goes to zero in the limit of low

138
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:14,930
temperatures or infinite beta. So this is a simple

139
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:17,840
but not trivial example where the heat capacity is

140
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:23,610
not always zero. But we still have limits in which

141
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:29,790
it equals zero when the well, we can check that in

142
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:34,970
those limits. We want. The energy of each

143
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:39,440
microstates to equal the expectation value with no

144
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,200
fluctuations. So that is perhaps the takeaway

145
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,980
message that we should have looked at before

146
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:50,610
switching back here so we can recall that when we

147
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:55,560
have. Very low temperatures, the probability for

148
00:11:55,560 --> 00:12:00,270
the system to be in any micro state other than its

149
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:03,300
ground state is exponentially suppressed. It

150
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:09,580
vanishes exponentially quickly. In the in terms of

151
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:13,800
the energy gap. Which for these things is.

152
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:21,610
To. Age, the change in the energy that we get when

153
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:25,270
we flip one of these spins from oriented with the

154
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:28,390
magnetic field of giving a low energy to oriented

155
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:31,360
against, it's giving a high energy. So as the

156
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,380
temperature goes to zero, essentially only a

157
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:39,610
single microstates remains with non-negative

158
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:44,140
probability. And that is the ground state where

159
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:46,860
all the spins are aligned with the magnetic field

160
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:52,790
and it's its micro state. Energy is then so

161
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:59,060
trivially equal to the expectation value. The high

162
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:03,130
temperature limit with beta varnishing is a bit

163
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:06,040
more subtle because that's the case when every

164
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:10,960
possible microstates is equally likely just

165
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,750
because their energies are negligible compared to

166
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:18,430
the energy scale set by the temperature. So we're

167
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:19,300
free to.

168
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,270
Sample every single one of those microstates with.

169
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:28,690
What appear to be different energies and the way

170
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:32,140
that we end up with the high capacity going to

171
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:36,490
zero in that limit is that all of those energies

172
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:39,910
are so small compared to the temperature that they

173
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:44,900
are effectively zero. And with no fluctuations,

174
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:50,150
then around that zero, the expectation value, so

175
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:55,040
that is the physical picture behind the

176
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,700
mathematics we're looking at here and an example

177
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:02,840
showing how we don't need this constraint, that

178
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:06,410
the high capacity always vanishes in order to have

179
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,470
that function vanish under some particular

180
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:13,900
conditions on the micro state energies.

181
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:22,470
I haven't seen. Questions come in about the

182
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:25,590
computer projects, homework solutions or other

183
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:31,590
asynchronous materials so far, so I'll pause for a

184
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:33,750
few breaths to see if there are follow up

185
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:37,560
questions about that, that last part of question

186
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,040
three.

187
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:46,600
And I can remember while waiting for those that. I

188
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:50,140
did make another notes about generic feedback on

189
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:53,770
the assignment, which was that the vast majority

190
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:58,330
of the marks that were lost were were lost for

191
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:03,250
parts of problems that were skipped, not not

192
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:06,610
answered, rather than doing things incorrectly. So

193
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:11,350
on the one hand, that's encouraging that when

194
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,530
solutions were presented, they tended to be

195
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:17,950
correct. And then the.

196
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,580
The question is whether the the absence of an

197
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:26,850
attempt was just due to a lack of time and too

198
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:29,760
many things going on, or if there were questions

199
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:35,690
about even where to get started, which. You are

200
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:41,320
always free to ask me. And. I'll figure out what

201
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,930
what answer I'm able to give for these sort of

202
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:46,690
assessed these sort of assessments.

203
00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:01,620
So now they're seeing or hearing any questions, I

204
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:08,710
will raise one other quick topic, which only. Seem

205
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,520
to be an issue on on a few submissions, which

206
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:17,770
noted in the very first part of the first problem

207
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,270
that the.

208
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:25,060
The most likely step size in this random question

209
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:30,190
was identical to its in the expectation value of

210
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:34,910
one. And there were some comments to the effect

211
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:39,260
that this should always be expected as a general

212
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,220
principle, so.

213
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:44,550
I think I would want to.

214
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:51,190
Pull. Those of you here, see?

215
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:58,760
What you all think about the conditions under

216
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:02,480
which the mean of a probability distribution is

217
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,830
this most likely value.

218
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,840
Where we saw in the in the homework problem that

219
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:14,040
that both of those were AMURO equals one was

220
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:17,730
trouble with value, X equals one. See if that is

221
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:24,840
something generic or only results from particular

222
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,240
conditions.

223
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,770
So I'll pause for a minute or two. To give you a

224
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:42,740
chance to think about and respond to that, and I

225
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:43,490
see.

226
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:51,070
Questions in the chat on.

227
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,170
Yeah, so while we while you are thinking about the

228
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:03,270
question, I can just correct one statement in the

229
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:06,990
chat that the mean scores were actually not so bad

230
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:09,510
on the assignment's. The mean for the first part

231
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:13,320
of the computer project was sixty five, which is

232
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,800
toward the upper end of the interval, I'm told I'm

233
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,860
supposed to target in the UK system in the mean

234
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:22,860
for the homework assignment was fifty five, which

235
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:27,600
as at the the lower end of that bracket, both,

236
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:35,170
both pretty much right on target for. For the for

237
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:39,580
the module and in the U.K. system, so. I don't

238
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:43,240
think there's any reason to panic, and of course,

239
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:47,050
there were some scores much better than than those

240
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:50,980
averages, as I said, the most of the marks were

241
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,080
lost from.

242
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:57,740
From emitting answers to two questions, skipping

243
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:01,010
those rather than doing things incorrectly, so.

244
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:08,100
I think for the most part, we are in good shape to

245
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,820
to meet all the learning outcomes and of course,

246
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:14,250
if you are having any difficulties, that's what

247
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,950
I'm here for during the office hours and

248
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:19,710
asynchronous communication.

249
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:48,950
The issue with canvas is I think there are several

250
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:53,030
students who are still registered on the canvas

251
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:56,330
sites but have either withdrawn from this

252
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:59,300
particular module or from cities as a whole. One

253
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,580
of them is just a test student. So there are

254
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:06,200
multiple non submissions that canvas is

255
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,540
incorrectly averaging over, I think, in the

256
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:13,460
numbers that you are looking at. So that is always

257
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:16,080
going to to pull things down.

258
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:21,940
And let's see.

259
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:30,400
We have some responses coming in to. The question

260
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,060
here.

261
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:50,790
In a way, just another minute to see if any more

262
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:55,620
consideration is needed for those of you still.

263
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:00,500
Thinking about. This.

264
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:03,570
This question.

265
00:21:54,830 --> 00:22:01,490
Taking a look at the. Responses, if I can get to

266
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:07,660
them. There is an even split between saying that

267
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:11,770
we need to compute things on a case by case basis

268
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:17,710
and the. Choice that there is.

269
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:22,960
Only agreement between the mean, the most likely

270
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:29,980
value when the distribution is symmetric. And. I

271
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:34,680
put in that that response be thinking in advance,

272
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:40,870
that's. It would be a tempting option, but it's

273
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:43,870
true that the mean is is not always the most

274
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:47,650
likely value. We actually saw an example of that

275
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:54,910
in the computer project demonstration, which.

276
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,710
Which I won't bother to bring up since nobody.

277
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:06,480
Selected either either of a or or response, see

278
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,990
where in the in the demo for the computer project,

279
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:13,650
we looked at a monotonic distribution where the

280
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:16,410
mean and the most likely value were not the same.

281
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:23,580
And if I hop over to a whiteboard here quickly, I

282
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:29,820
want to show off a counterexample for a

283
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:32,070
probability distribution that.

284
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,320
Has a.

285
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:44,530
Is the following form where I won't bother to

286
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:48,130
compute the constant that comes out over overall,

287
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:52,510
but I will say that the probability distribution

288
00:23:52,510 --> 00:24:02,110
is the sine squared of X for X from minus Pi to Pi

289
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:10,410
in zero otherwise. So that if we. You know, that

290
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:14,130
probability distribution, that the constant factor

291
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:16,830
C can come from.

292
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:24,430
With a smaller line width that can be fixed by

293
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:29,730
requiring that. The integral over the probability

294
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:33,210
distribution equals one across this, its whole

295
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:35,340
range and.

296
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:42,820
Plotting this distribution, we know that the.

297
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:49,180
The sign of high and minus pi is zero. There's

298
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:53,140
been a maximum of sine squared at both plus and

299
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:58,150
minus PI over two and the sine I don't know why it

300
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:01,420
spontaneously zoomed out like that as I tried to

301
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:07,710
draw things, but. Plot four P of X vs. X from

302
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:15,190
minus Pi to Pi then takes the form. Of that,

303
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:25,510
which we can see has. You mean value, so that's X,

304
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:31,750
the integral from minus play pie of.

305
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:41,580
X times square root of X X, which is an odd

306
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:45,480
function over an even range around zero, so that

307
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:51,300
mean value is right at zero there. So that's the

308
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:54,840
the mean, whereas there are actually two

309
00:25:55,020 --> 00:26:01,550
degenerate most likely values which come when. The

310
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:05,570
derivative of the probability distribution is set

311
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:08,120
to zero and check to be a maximum rather than a

312
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:13,330
minimum. And those most likely values are at plus

313
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:21,260
and minus pi over two rather than. That's me value

314
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:24,200
zero, even though the probability distribution is

315
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:30,500
symmetric around zero and around, it's me. So the.

316
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:38,470
The ultimate answer to this poll is that both the

317
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:41,530
mean and the most likely value would have to be

318
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:44,890
computed and compared on a case by case basis, one

319
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:50,770
of them corresponds to that integral over the

320
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:55,720
probability distribution of of X, whereas the

321
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:59,500
other corresponds to setting the derivative of the

322
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:02,860
probability distribution to zero and then checking

323
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:05,950
to see whether we have a maximum or a minimum.

324
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:22,260
So that is all that I was going to.

325
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:28,990
Talk about in terms of the assessment and

326
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:32,590
assignments of the computer project due tomorrow

327
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:37,360
and the D homework solutions here where the

328
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:41,800
feedback came back over break. Well, maybe one

329
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,830
last thing I can mention quickly was in the

330
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:48,100
High-temperature expansion for the last problem,

331
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:53,470
there were at least some difficulties. Converting

332
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:54,370
between.

333
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:57,340
The.

334
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:06,350
These two forms of. Asymptotic expansion's in

335
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:10,160
terms of expanding a function in the denominator

336
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:15,290
of a ratio and getting that into the the standard

337
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:21,150
form for an asthmatic expansion, where this these

338
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:25,910
higher powers of the small expansion parameter

339
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,830
show up as additive factors rather than appearing.

340
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:38,990
Underneath or in the in the denominator of Horatio?

341
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:44,510
And there are one example here, which is a

342
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:45,200
standard

343
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:54,290
expansion that you can look up in in tables of of

344
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:58,130
series or through Mathematica or programs like

345
00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:01,930
that. Where in order to.

346
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:08,430
Expand this ratio in the usual geometric series

347
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:11,910
approach, we have to get it into the form of one

348
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:16,740
over one minus something small and then expanding

349
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:21,300
those that something small in the geometric series

350
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:26,070
allows us to rearrange things in terms of. The

351
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:32,160
powers of the. The expansion parameter X that

352
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:37,560
appear, and perhaps the key here is that the

353
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:40,830
manipulation is necessary in order to get things

354
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:43,890
into the geometric series form, bring out this

355
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:48,840
overall factor of one over X that comes along for

356
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:54,970
the ride. And affects. What what order has to be

357
00:29:55,240 --> 00:30:00,350
retained within the geometric series expansion? So

358
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:03,710
that once is once the powers of the exchange

359
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:07,450
operator are knocked down by this overall factor,

360
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:13,240
we end up with the given asymptotic behavior. So

361
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:18,340
what we have at the end in this case is a series

362
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:22,060
rather than a Taylor series with negative powers

363
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:27,220
of the expansion Parameter X appearing as well as

364
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:32,050
positive powers. Apart from that, it's a matter of.

365
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:37,440
Keeping track of the terms that appear in these

366
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:42,700
expressions and organizing them. In terms of the

367
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:46,990
small expansion parameter X, which has been a

368
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:56,430
times here. And. Looking now at the.

369
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:01,100
The secret is material for.

370
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:07,820
The coming week will one last check to see if

371
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:12,830
there are questions about assessment or the

372
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:14,060
computer project.

373
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:27,550
And feel free to interrupt as. I go on, I think it

374
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:33,510
would be. Useful due to the break over the past

375
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:39,100
few weeks, just to. Take a quick look back at what

376
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:43,570
we did before that break in terms of introducing

377
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:48,880
and defining and developing the three statistical

378
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:53,470
ensembles that that formed the.

379
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,410
This is the spine or the skeleton, the core of

380
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:05,050
this module, where over the next few weeks we will

381
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:08,110
be applying the last of those grand canonical

382
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:09,730
ensemble in the.

383
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:16,050
Context of quantum gases that we will develop

384
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:19,740
later this week so that there are some solid

385
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:22,590
concepts there, which we may get to today, may

386
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:25,010
save until Thursday.

387
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:33,230
In the meantime, we will.

388
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:41,490
Take a few minutes for review to put those three

389
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:47,060
ensembles right next to each other in.

390
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,170
In a row here, starting with.

391
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:56,970
The MicroCon conical ensemble and the canonical

392
00:32:56,970 --> 00:33:01,170
ensemble and finally the. Grand economical

393
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:04,290
ensemble. So in all three cases we have.

394
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:14,770
In mind that a physical system is evolving in time

395
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:16,180
and as it evolves.

396
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:21,860
It is probabilistically sampling all of the

397
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:24,980
possible states that are accessible to it's

398
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:29,390
subject to certain constraints, and in the micro

399
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:35,270
canonical case, those constraints are the very

400
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:39,380
direct physical laws that energy and particle

401
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:43,880
number need to be conserved. So if we draw our

402
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:46,010
system and zoom back in,

403
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:52,260
we draw our system as. Some box we can even

404
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:55,830
imagine, that box has a bowling and V in which we

405
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:56,370
have.

406
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:05,070
Whatever. Particles for other constituents, we are

407
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:05,820
interested in

408
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:15,910
the energy. In particle number are fixed, which

409
00:34:15,910 --> 00:34:19,690
means that this system we're describing with the

410
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:22,480
micro conical ensemble has to be completely

411
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:26,650
isolated from all the rest of the universe. So

412
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:31,600
there is some Hardwell around it through which no

413
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,820
particles to pass and through which, in fact, no

414
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:38,260
energy can pass in order to ensure that both

415
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:43,320
energy and particle number remain fixed. So this

416
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,060
is sort of

417
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:50,340
a straightforward application of the sort of

418
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:53,910
conservation laws that play an important role in

419
00:34:53,910 --> 00:34:57,510
physics, but it is something that's hard to to set

420
00:34:57,510 --> 00:35:04,500
up in practice developing. A an experimental setup

421
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:08,070
or or a situation where some system is completely

422
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:11,550
isolated from everything around it and that

423
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:18,590
difficulty motivates. The consideration of the

424
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:19,830
economical ensemble.

425
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:27,800
Where we still have our system. In some boxes

426
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:33,200
flying V.. With that same fixed number of

427
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:37,060
particles. Or whatever other constituents are in

428
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:41,650
there, but now we allow the energy to fluctuate.

429
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:52,270
By. Exchange of energy with. Some external system

430
00:35:52,510 --> 00:36:00,020
that. We. Imagine to be significantly larger than

431
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:03,540
than the system of interest in this takes the form.

432
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:06,890
Of a thermal reservoir.

433
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:18,210
That has enough degrees of freedom. That it can

434
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:23,470
fix the the temperature through. Contact them

435
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:27,300
through exchange of energy. Between the system of

436
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:31,170
interest in its selling container, fixing the

437
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:37,040
particle number and the overall thermal energy, I

438
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:39,690
perhaps should have mentioned the micro canonical

439
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:44,940
context that the temperature was a derived

440
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:51,300
quantity as a function of entropy, as a function

441
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:54,180
of energy. The interview is always a derived

442
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:58,560
quantity and all of these cases. And now when we

443
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:02,310
go to the canonical ensemble. Where the NRC is

444
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:07,470
allowed to fluctuate the. Expectation value of

445
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:12,130
that energy. Becomes a derived quantity that is a

446
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:15,250
function now of the fixed temperature being fixed

447
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:17,170
by that thermal reservoir.

448
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:25,000
In the final case that. Was introduced in the week

449
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
before break and will be our subject going forward

450
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:29,320
is.

451
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:34,110
The so-called grand canonical ensemble where

452
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:42,820
the pattern set by. The. Evolution from

453
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:46,290
microeconomics is economical to continues now

454
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:50,590
instead of fixing either E or N, we allow both the

455
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:53,230
energy and particle number to fluctuate. So I'll

456
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:54,550
draw a

457
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:02,230
container here that does not look so solid and

458
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:06,670
allows both energy and particle number or energy

459
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:10,240
and particles to flow freely into and out of the

460
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,300
system. And again, the temperature is fixed

461
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:17,050
through energy exchange with a large external

462
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:20,830
reservoir. And now we also fix the chemical

463
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:24,550
potential move through through that exchange of

464
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:28,420
particles with that large external reservoir.

465
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:34,330
Which is now. Not merely a thermal reservoir, but

466
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:37,920
also a. Critical reservoir.

467
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:47,950
And it is possible for both energy. And particles

468
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:51,550
to be interchanged between the system and its

469
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:56,800
surroundings, making now the expectation value for

470
00:38:56,950 --> 00:39:00,490
the particle. No, he derived quantity. That

471
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:04,900
depends both on the temperature and on that

472
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:09,760
chemical potential. So here are.

473
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:14,550
Those three cases all next to each other, showing

474
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:19,020
the sort of systematic variation in terms of what

475
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:22,140
quantities are kept fixed and how.

476
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:40,020
So that is the the context for. Week seven and the

477
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:46,050
following few weeks about the application of the

478
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:49,170
grand canonical ensemble in the context of quantum

479
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:52,240
statistics. Where?

480
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,940
The starting point now, well, the other ingredient,

481
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,970
in addition to the definition of the great

482
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:04,770
Kilmichael ensemble that we got before the break

483
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:08,610
is what exactly are.

484
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,280
Our quantum statistics and how do they differ from

485
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:19,260
the classical or non quantum statistics that we

486
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:20,250
have been looking at?

487
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:26,610
You know, the context picture again, is there.

488
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:32,790
And you know, this is being recorded, so it will.

489
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:36,590
Show up on on that recording.

490
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:43,130
And I'll leave it up as I may be introduced to the

491
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:49,800
last little Cole, I will. Bring up today, which I

492
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,670
can introduce.

493
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:56,980
Perhaps speaking out loud for a few minutes before

494
00:40:57,130 --> 00:41:01,360
writing anything that someone said we'll see with

495
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,130
quantum statistics, is that.

496
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:10,670
The quantization of the energies of the particles

497
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:14,420
in the system is a necessary but not sufficient

498
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:19,470
condition to. To get to quantum statistics, to

499
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:21,810
have a system that is described by by quantum

500
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:24,300
physics and to reiterate, you don't need to know

501
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,100
anything about quantum physics coming into this

502
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:31,800
module and there won't be any instruction or

503
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:34,390
information in quantum mechanics coming out of it.

504
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:38,430
So this is basically just developing a set of

505
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:42,720
conjectures to introduce interesting statistical

506
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:46,500
systems that we can analyze with the tools that we

507
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:51,090
have available. One of which we we actually looked

508
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:56,280
at back in week, for which I will cut back to now

509
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,710
and be in the material we.

510
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,650
When we were considering an ideal gas, we saw that

511
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:08,900
we had to quantize the momentum of the gas

512
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:14,930
particles and therefore their energies that that

513
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:20,270
depend on those momentum in order to get a

514
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:24,350
well-defined canonical partition function as a sum

515
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:28,810
over accountable number of microstates. So there

516
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:35,680
was a quick computation that. With these. Quantize

517
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:40,820
energy with these quantize momenta. The overall

518
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:46,800
energies were some. Constant, every factor that

519
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:47,940
depends on.

520
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:56,650
The the length or the the volume that we assume

521
00:42:56,650 --> 00:43:02,230
are particles are in. And then the moments are

522
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:02,740
just.

523
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:07,930
Integer.

524
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:22,390
Just to sum over integer value, K, X, Y and. OK, Z,

525
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:28,390
take values zero, one, two, and so on, with every

526
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:32,590
factor taking those pure numbers caved into

527
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:38,380
physical momentum, mental units of. Mass times

528
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:47,880
velocity and. Looking at. Those energies we saw

529
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:53,510
that the lowest energy levels. Were.

530
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:59,110
Or I should say the lowest energies and.

531
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:07,820
The form of that concept, refactored times, either

532
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:10,970
zero or one or two, which.

533
00:44:13,090 --> 00:44:17,290
Should be able to look at in the next fall that

534
00:44:17,290 --> 00:44:19,030
I'll activate.

535
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:26,160
And, you know, there's a typo there that the.

536
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:33,620
There's a typo in what I did before earlier, sorry

537
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:37,730
that I left out the two times m factor in the

538
00:44:37,730 --> 00:44:39,680
energies that I can.

539
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:46,910
Quickly restore, that is why I write these things

540
00:44:46,910 --> 00:44:51,320
down ahead of time, and the question here is has

541
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:54,560
to do with the terminology introduced at the.

542
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:01,730
Start of the written material for this week, which

543
00:45:01,730 --> 00:45:06,170
distinguishes between energy levels and the actual

544
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:10,940
value of the energy that any given energy level

545
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:14,330
has. And in particular, there's a possibly

546
00:45:14,510 --> 00:45:17,780
confusing aspect of that terminology, that it is

547
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:21,500
possible to have multiple distinct energy levels

548
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:26,270
that all have the identical value of the energy

549
00:45:27,470 --> 00:45:32,670
which. Is actually something we saw back in the

550
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:35,010
case of the classical ideal gas and before.

551
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:44,830
And. Question here is a quick reminder of our

552
00:45:44,830 --> 00:45:48,010
discussion from back then asking what were the

553
00:45:48,030 --> 00:45:50,830
agenda races for the.

554
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:56,850
The three lowest energy, so how many different

555
00:45:56,850 --> 00:46:02,940
energy levels are there at all have the same value

556
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:04,740
of the energy?

557
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:20,020
There's just a few minutes left in.

558
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:25,270
In the meeting today, so.

559
00:46:27,350 --> 00:46:32,220
I will give you those few minutes to. To think

560
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:35,760
about and recall, that's a derivation from week

561
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:42,210
four that I just reviewed and. I can bring that

562
00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:46,440
back up rather than showing the the question that

563
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:51,710
you can look at yourselves.

564
00:47:02,510 --> 00:47:06,080
Is pausing the final couple of minutes to.

565
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:11,620
To see what you find for.

566
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:18,400
For the DeGeneres's corresponding to these

567
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:19,090
entities.

568
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:54,350
And in the interests of of time and running out of

569
00:48:54,350 --> 00:48:57,260
time, this will be the last call for

570
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:00,650
four responses.

571
00:49:24,450 --> 00:49:25,050
And.

572
00:49:27,070 --> 00:49:33,430
And since I see disagreements in those. Responses,

573
00:49:33,430 --> 00:49:36,900
an even split between two of the options. I'll

574
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:41,280
just go through and. Quickly sketch out the the

575
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:44,550
answer to that which we did look at in some

576
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:48,150
previous meeting that is recorded somewhere, but

577
00:49:48,870 --> 00:49:52,470
you all for responses noted that there was only a

578
00:49:52,470 --> 00:49:55,830
single way to get zero energy out of this

579
00:49:55,830 --> 00:50:03,600
expression, which was that all of X, Y and Z had

580
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:04,260
to equal.

581
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:11,430
Zero. In order for the energy to vanish, for the

582
00:50:11,430 --> 00:50:15,150
energy e one, they have a single unit of that

583
00:50:15,150 --> 00:50:23,610
prefecture. We just need one of those. Case to be

584
00:50:23,610 --> 00:50:28,620
won while the others are zero, there are three

585
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:31,290
ways of managing that.

586
00:50:35,090 --> 00:50:37,250
And similarly for.

587
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:44,620
To get two units of energy, we need to case to be

588
00:50:45,310 --> 00:50:48,160
one while the last one is zero. And there are

589
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:53,330
again three ways of. Setting that up.

590
00:50:55,860 --> 00:50:56,490
So.

591
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:02,360
The point of this exercise is just to serve as a

592
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:07,460
reminder, something we saw earlier, that there are.

593
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:10,980
Multiple possible distinct states in typical

594
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:15,660
systems that can all have the same energy. And

595
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:21,360
that is the justification and motivation for the.

596
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:26,950
Terminology or the syntax that is introduced here,

597
00:51:26,950 --> 00:51:31,300
where the energy levels are labeled by these

598
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:36,100
calligraphic ès and those are what are actually

599
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:39,640
being counted and just revised or quantized in the

600
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:43,270
case of quantum statistics, and the actual value

601
00:51:43,690 --> 00:51:48,940
of the energy for each energy level may well be

602
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:53,230
the same for multiple distinct energy levels,

603
00:51:53,230 --> 00:51:56,500
which is the case in the example that we already

604
00:51:56,500 --> 00:52:02,460
saw before the break. So I will stop there. I'll

605
00:52:02,470 --> 00:52:04,510
stick around for just a couple of minutes in case

606
00:52:04,510 --> 00:52:07,090
there are quick last minute questions. Then I'll

607
00:52:07,310 --> 00:52:10,750
I'll need to shut down the meeting to extract the

608
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:12,100
recording.

609
00:52:14,650 --> 00:52:15,340
And.

610
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:21,950
I see one question came in after I shut down the

611
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:23,810
office hours will start at the top of the hour.

612
00:52:24,090 --> 00:52:27,510
There will definitely be past exam papers. The one

613
00:52:27,510 --> 00:52:29,310
from last year should already be up. I will

614
00:52:29,310 --> 00:52:33,270
investigate why it is not. And then a second one

615
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:38,790
will come up over the next couple of weeks. So

616
00:52:38,790 --> 00:52:43,720
sorry for that oversight, I thought. The 20/20

617
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:48,670
sample exam was already available, and it will get

618
00:52:48,670 --> 00:52:52,300
up as soon as possible. So thanks for pointing

619
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:57,490
that out and all of you take care with the the

620
00:52:57,490 --> 00:52:59,920
rest of your day and the resumption of term.
