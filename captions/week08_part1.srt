00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:04,750
Hello and welcome back to a statistical physics.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:09,050
This is the first video for eight in the module

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,530
and following the pattern established with this

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:17,490
will provide a brief summary of the context,

5
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:20,790
motivations and key learning outcomes to take away

6
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:25,120
from the asynchronous materials for this week. And

7
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:29,190
speaking of those materials, bring them up on the

8
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:34,020
screen here and see where we are in the module and

9
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:39,660
where we are headed. So indicate we are digging

10
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,110
into our application of the grand canonical

11
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:46,950
ensemble in the context of quantum gases of

12
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:52,620
boatswain's. The first of two weeks investigating

13
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:57,300
in some detail the behavior of quantum systems for

14
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:59,790
the different types of particles that we

15
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:04,020
introduced in in last week's material in quantum

16
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:08,130
statistics. So just as a brief refresher, the

17
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,560
grand canonical example that we are applying

18
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:15,630
allows both of the energy and particle number of

19
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:18,480
our statistical system to fluctuate through

20
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:23,010
exchange with some large external reservoir. And

21
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:28,590
we are gaining familiarity with this approach to

22
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:32,580
analyzing statistical systems by considering

23
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:36,360
quantum systems this way, quantum gases of those

24
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:37,140
arms where

25
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,440
quantum as opposed to classical statistical

26
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:48,780
physics is defined by how we define the

27
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,830
microstates being considered and the definition of

28
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:55,680
the fundamental grand canonical partition function

29
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:03,600
that defines our system and its. It's physical

30
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,870
behavior, so in the classical approach, the

31
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:09,600
partition function was defined by considering all

32
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,240
the particles in the system one by one, and

33
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,520
something over all the possible energies that they

34
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,240
could have in the quantum approach. We saw that

35
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,870
deficiencies in that classical approach could be

36
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:28,200
fixed or corrected by instead summing over every

37
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:32,130
discrete energy level in the system and

38
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:34,830
considering all the possible occupation numbers

39
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,880
that that energy level could have. Where the

40
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,310
possible occupation numbers distinguish between

41
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:44,460
the two classes of particles of the universe,

42
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:50,040
bosons that behave in the familiar way where each

43
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,810
energy level can have any non-negative number of

44
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:59,460
identical particles zero, one, two and so on, as

45
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:02,130
opposed to fermions for only a maximum single

46
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:06,360
particle in energy level is possible. So this week

47
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:13,350
we are focusing on the ozone in case you are

48
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:15,450
quantum gases of bosons.

49
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,550
Beginning from the grand finale, coopetition

50
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:23,970
function and potential that were derived in

51
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:27,540
general terms the last week, looking at quantum

52
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:32,660
statistics in the abstract, where these. Partition

53
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,970
function and potential depend on the as yet

54
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:39,230
unspecified energies of the energy levels that are

55
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:43,040
being sent over to define the system, and in

56
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,830
general, there are two possibilities that we can

57
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:46,760
consider

58
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:53,420
characterized by how the energies of the energy

59
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:57,350
levels depend on the quantized momenta of the

60
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:00,680
particles that are allowed by by quantum physics,

61
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:05,000
which we are again doubting as a Anzac's or

62
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,780
conjecture.

63
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:12,120
Rather than relying on any prior knowledge of

64
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,710
quantum mechanics or quantum physics and the non

65
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:19,380
unrealistic case we already looked at back in the

66
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:21,840
week for the classical ideal gas, where we

67
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,690
introduced this relativistic and non relativistic

68
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:28,020
terminology, and in the quantum context, it turns

69
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:31,920
out to be a significantly simpler calculation on

70
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,800
the calculation calculational level to focus on

71
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:38,610
the relativistic case, which is epitomized by.

72
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:44,310
The behavior of quantum particles of light, what

73
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:45,780
are known as photons,

74
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:51,210
these photons, these particles of light are as

75
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:55,260
relativistic as particles can get in the sense

76
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:59,430
that they are characterized by energies that are

77
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:03,900
linearly proportional to the photon momentum as

78
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:07,500
opposed to the quadratic dependence that we looked

79
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,670
at from the non relativistic case back before the

80
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,370
term break.

81
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:19,160
And going through the same exercise of quanti

82
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,680
using these momenta.

83
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:27,120
In a fixed volume V, they can depend only on

84
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,380
integer multiples of this combination pie over the

85
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,870
linear length of that volume times Planck's

86
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:40,440
constant each bar, we are able to connect these

87
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:45,180
photon energies that are now quantized to the

88
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,780
behavior, to the wavelength or equivalently the

89
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:55,200
frequency of the photons interpreted as radiation,

90
00:05:55,470 --> 00:06:03,300
as particles of light, where the conventional

91
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:07,830
presentation of the conventional definition of a

92
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:11,550
photon energy is given in terms of its frequency

93
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,740
multiplied by playing scales to convert units

94
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,230
appropriately to get an energy.

95
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:27,290
So plugging in that background, specifying photons

96
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:30,590
by how their energy levels depend on their

97
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:35,820
quantized momenta wavelengths and frequencies. We

98
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:40,890
can benefit significantly from the simplification

99
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:45,480
that photons are very easy to create and destroy,

100
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,770
which allows us to consider the system and to

101
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,740
limit where the chemical potential vanishes. And

102
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:58,770
this is the key simplification that provides the.

103
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:03,090
Much more streamlined and much more accessible

104
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:06,930
calculations compared to the the nonrelated tested

105
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:11,130
case. That while there's still interesting in the

106
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:15,180
Nominals Vista case, we can consider a quantum

107
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,970
phase transition in a new state of matter known as

108
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:20,420
those Einstein condensation related to the Bose

109
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:23,370
Einstein statistics of non relativistic

110
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:28,440
boatswain's, that turns out to be much more

111
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:32,430
complicated than the simple case of photons, which

112
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:37,980
is all that we will focus on in this module.

113
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:43,250
Though we could discuss the nominals of the case,

114
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,840
at least in general terms, in the synchronous

115
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,620
session if there is interest in doing so. So with

116
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:52,760
that background set up, it is a fairly

117
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:58,200
straightforward calculation to. Specify the

118
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,950
particular form of the grant canonical potential

119
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:05,280
related to the logarithm of the grand canonical

120
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:10,770
partition function that is specific to the photon

121
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:14,960
energy levels. Related to their quantize momentum

122
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:19,950
and given the length of the next section and the

123
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,950
length. The amount of time that is already on the

124
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:27,100
clock, it will stop this recording here a bit

125
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:30,550
early and pick up with the remainder of.

126
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,870
Summarizing the remainder of the week's material

127
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,630
in the next video.
