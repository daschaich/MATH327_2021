1
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,950
OK, the recording should now be under way, and

2
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:13,800
we'll see if any more folks come in in the next

3
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:18,710
few minutes. And in the meantime, you can just get

4
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:22,070
set up with some of the usual.

5
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,890
Logistical, organizational matters, and in

6
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,860
particular, giving those of you who are here the

7
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:36,790
opportunity to. But again, any questions you may

8
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:42,330
have either for yourself, for. For the future use

9
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:44,700
of those watching the recording.

10
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:47,360
In the.

11
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:58,060
Few logistical notes today are that the next and

12
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:00,790
final homework assignment is due tomorrow. Some

13
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:03,700
have already come in, though there's still time to

14
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:08,860
resubmit them if you see any changes or

15
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:12,670
improvements you'd like to make. And after that,

16
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:16,150
the only remaining piece of assessment will be the

17
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:20,230
final exam, which has been scheduled for a month

18
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:24,640
from yesterday, the Tuesday, the twenty fifth of

19
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:31,150
May. So as we wrap up with the interim assessment,

20
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:35,200
there'll be some more. Practice problems and other

21
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:41,370
simple materials uploaded in preparation. For that.

22
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:49,740
One other piece of logistics is that next Monday

23
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:54,930
is a holiday in the U.K.. So you may have seen.

24
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:59,150
From the somewhat flaky calendar on canvas that.

25
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:03,850
There is no synchronous session scheduled that day,

26
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:07,810
though, I expect still to be around for all of

27
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:08,590
this hours.

28
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:18,980
Just taking a quick look to see whether there are

29
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:23,360
any immediate questions about the homework or the

30
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:27,470
asynchronous materials for the module up till now.

31
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:39,920
I don't see any. Coming in so far so they can jump

32
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,240
over to those materials and just keep going

33
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:50,610
through them steadily ramping up the. Quantum gas

34
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:54,390
is a bosun's that was the material for last week

35
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:58,290
and then getting into the quantum gases of

36
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:02,740
fermions. And that we will deal with for the

37
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:06,790
remainder of this week leading up to the bank

38
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:13,740
holiday. Next Monday and where we left off with.

39
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:18,160
Last week saw our discussion last Thursday about

40
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:21,070
one of the assets of those islands was applying

41
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,840
the idealized calculations that we were doing for

42
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:32,380
a photon gas. The. Not an intern or a guess of not

43
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:36,640
interacting particles that obey the relativistic.

44
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:40,750
Energy momentum relation.

45
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:48,710
That the energy. The photon is just the speed of

46
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:51,980
light at times as momentum p, which is equivalent

47
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:54,710
to a Planck's constant four times the photon

48
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:58,040
frequency omega. We saw that

49
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:01,280
that simple.

50
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:09,910
Approximation, which is known as the. The black

51
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:15,230
body model and I can. Elaborate briefly on where

52
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:17,750
that name comes from. For the curious, a bit

53
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:20,750
simple, a curve of the plate distribution show

54
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:27,710
here as a function of wavelength, which is.

55
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:37,690
The inverse of the frequency, two factors of two

56
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:43,310
pi in the speed of light provides a. Pretty good

57
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:48,110
approximation to the light that is emitted by the

58
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:48,560
sun.

59
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:53,460
Which is shown to these colored bands here ready

60
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,760
for what we would measure at the surface of the

61
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:00,480
earth around sea level, and then yellow is coming

62
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:04,740
from measurements carried out by high altitude

63
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:08,010
observations, either climbing up mountains or

64
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:15,210
initially measured from high flying balloons. And

65
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:18,420
more recently, measured even on satellites, but.

66
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:22,990
These sorts of measurements predate the satellite

67
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:31,040
age and. Were some of the input observations that

68
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,370
that led Planck to develop the distribution that

69
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:37,580
now bears his name, this black line here that

70
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:44,810
matches the. Observed light from the sun to pretty

71
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:47,750
good precision, taking into account the fact that.

72
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:54,900
Interactions are not negligible in the sun, and we

73
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:59,340
can see they also interactions between photons and

74
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:02,820
these sorts of gases that exist in the sun, in the

75
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,070
space between the earth and the sun and also in

76
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,030
the earth's atmosphere. Can absorb a lot of these

77
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:11,850
photons that are easy to create and destroy,

78
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:15,650
corresponding to a vanishing chemical potential,

79
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:21,120
which leads to some of the different shape or the

80
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,980
different measurements you would get at high, high,

81
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:28,660
higher. Altitude or high position in the

82
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:32,940
atmosphere compared to sea level. And the black

83
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:38,160
body term, that was. In vogue at that time, it has

84
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,350
stayed around for that historical reason, just

85
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:46,730
comes from the idea that these objects being

86
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:50,510
considered that are radiating lights or the whole

87
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:53,310
spectrum of electromagnetic radiation from high

88
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:58,100
energy ultraviolet radiation down to low energy

89
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:02,060
infrared and thermal radiation, all of which

90
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:05,050
corresponds to photons with different frequencies

91
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:10,220
in different wavelengths. The black body is an

92
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:14,060
object that emits that sort of light or that sort

93
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:16,760
of electromagnetic radiation without having to

94
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:22,060
worry about it, reflecting any. Any radiation that

95
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:25,090
is in the environment, which there always is, if

96
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:28,900
there's like to see these bodies or a non-zero

97
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:32,770
temperature that is being carried by the

98
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,330
electromagnetic radiation, the ambient environment,

99
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:40,480
the idea is a black body simply absorbs all of

100
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,480
that external radiation and emits its own

101
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:47,800
radiation with no influence, no reflection coming

102
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,340
from all of that other stuff. So it's a

103
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:55,190
simplification that, like the simplification of a

104
00:07:55,210 --> 00:08:01,450
non interacting gas, turns out to describe not

105
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:03,970
only the sun, but also things like ovens and light

106
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:06,880
bulbs and all other sources of electromagnetic

107
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:12,270
radiation very well. And another extreme that we

108
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:16,620
can look at, where the BlackBerry curve for the

109
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:20,760
blank distribution matches up even better with the

110
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:25,860
observed spectrum of electromagnetic radiation is

111
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:29,570
something known as the cosmic microwave background.

112
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:35,840
Which is illustrated in in this picture here,

113
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,530
which is a.

114
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:44,430
Famous image. Or one of the classic famous images

115
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:47,970
that is showing a picture of the entire visible

116
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:53,100
sky with all of the stars and galaxies and other.

117
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:59,440
Known sources of heat and light subtracted away

118
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:05,050
and removed from it and what is left? Is what we

119
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:08,320
would consider empty space and what is being done

120
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:13,120
in this picture is that the temperature of that

121
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:18,810
empty space? With no contributions from galaxies

122
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:24,210
and stars is being colored depending on whether

123
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:26,640
the temperature is a little higher than average or

124
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:31,290
a little lower than average. So the the colors

125
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:34,530
here are illustrations of fluctuations around the

126
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:38,460
average temperature of the entire sky, the entire

127
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:43,260
observable universe. That average temperature has

128
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,630
been measured very precisely to be about two point

129
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:49,500
seventy five Kelvin. And that average is attracted

130
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:54,600
away from each points in this picture. And what is

131
00:09:54,600 --> 00:10:00,090
left are hotter regions colored in red or orange

132
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:05,130
or reddish colors like that area over on the right

133
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:11,720
of the figure that are just a few. Millions of a

134
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:15,830
Kelvyn higher than average, I think the actual

135
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:22,930
number is one part in. 10000. And then the blue

136
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:25,870
colored regions are similarly about a part in

137
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:35,790
10000 cooler than average. And what this? Is is a

138
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:38,760
Gafsa photon, so a.

139
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,640
The gas of electromagnetic radiation that is

140
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:49,580
filling. The entirety of the empty space in the

141
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:53,300
observable universe, within and between galaxies,

142
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:57,230
that dates back to the early stages of the

143
00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:00,240
universe's evolution. If.

144
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:09,670
We pull up a. Illustration of. The universe's

145
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,290
evolution here.

146
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:18,010
From measurements of this cosmic microwave

147
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,770
background that we were just looking at, along

148
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:21,400
with other.

149
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:27,100
Other observable facets of cosmology and the

150
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,150
observable universe.

151
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:32,170
We've been able to measure and this is a.

152
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:36,220
This picture is being shown on a program that

153
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:39,100
doesn't let me scribble on it, so we'll just have

154
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:43,930
to to look at it. Without the benefit of any

155
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:48,290
drawing, so we know that the age of the universe

156
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:52,340
from the early stages of what's called the Big

157
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:54,410
Bang, when the universe was a very hot and then

158
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:57,530
state has been about thirteen point eight billion

159
00:11:57,530 --> 00:12:02,590
years. In the cosmic microwave background that

160
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:06,070
pervades all of the universe is essentially.

161
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,850
An imprint of the universe in its early days,

162
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:15,280
about three hundred eighty thousand years after.

163
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,520
It was formed after that big bang, and that was

164
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:22,640
the point where the universe had expanded and

165
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:29,960
cooled enough. That. Electrons and atomic nuclei

166
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:34,640
were able to bind to form neutral atoms, which

167
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:39,440
allowed the light that we can see in the sky to

168
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,010
propagate freely rather than being absorbed and

169
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:48,860
created by those electrons and charged atomic

170
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:55,380
nuclei. So that was the point shown here, about

171
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,210
three hundred eighty thousand years after the Big

172
00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:03,390
Bang where. The light that we are now observing in

173
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:07,980
the cosmic microwave background was released and

174
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:12,480
allowed to travel freely again thirteen point

175
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,430
eight billion years ago, the three hundred eighty

176
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:18,240
thousand years is a rounding error in that overall

177
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,740
age of the universe.

178
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:25,230
And that light that has been traveling for

179
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:27,570
thirteen point eight billion years is what is

180
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:32,130
being observed to indicate the temperature

181
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:34,770
fluctuations shown in.

182
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:41,820
Joining this figure, which we can get back to, and

183
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:45,450
there's in addition to the scientific value of the

184
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:48,240
cosmic microwave background, which we'll get into

185
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:53,430
in just a minute, there was a famous story about

186
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:58,020
its discovery back in in nineteen sixty five and.

187
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:02,420
This is by Arnold Penzias and Robert Wilson, two

188
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:08,210
astronomers who were trying to set up a telescope

189
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:14,760
to measure. Long wavelength on low frequency radio

190
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,360
waves.

191
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:22,070
As a probe of astronomy and astrophysics, and

192
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,370
while they were setting up this telescope and

193
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:28,190
trying to to tune it to get rid of background

194
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:32,120
noise from terrestrial sources, radio broadcasts,

195
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,870
the sun and other nearby stars they kept.

196
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:42,060
Noticing this persistent hissing coming at low

197
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:46,370
frequency. Electromagnetic radiation, low

198
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:49,790
frequency photons coming almost uniformly from all

199
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:55,490
directions in the sky, that. With a bit of work,

200
00:14:55,970 --> 00:15:00,730
they were able to identify as precisely this, this

201
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:04,470
cosmic relic of the early stages of the universe.

202
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,130
So the cosmic microwave background, although it

203
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:12,380
had been predicted by some folks in the decades

204
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:14,900
before the 1960s, it was discovered accidentally

205
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:18,440
rather than by actually looking for it. And it was

206
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,590
only that accidental discovery which got a Nobel

207
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:27,430
Prize in the 70s that really. Helped to solidify

208
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:31,330
that big bang picture of the universe that we now

209
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:37,120
have and really lend credence to the predictions

210
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,040
that there would be this cosmic microwave

211
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,360
background. Pervading all of the empty space

212
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,400
between stars and galaxies.

213
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,300
Now.

214
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:58,680
I mentioned when looking at. This drawing here

215
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,770
that the average temperature being subtracted away

216
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:08,300
is about two point seventy five Kelvin, which I

217
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:12,450
every day standards, is quite low, one hundred

218
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:17,350
times lower than room temperature, roughly, and. I

219
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:21,710
also mentioned that. The the life here dates from

220
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:26,390
the very early stages of the universe when it was

221
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:29,510
just a fraction of a million years old, when the

222
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:31,550
universe itself was in a Honeyman state in

223
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:33,950
particular, so hot that

224
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:40,250
atoms had just started to to recombine. The

225
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,950
temperature was such that there was nearly enough

226
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:48,590
heat energy to ionized all of the atoms in the

227
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:52,070
universe, which is you can also see from this

228
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:55,100
figure was hundreds of millions of years before

229
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:59,960
the formation of dense structures like stars.

230
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:07,480
The universe was a more or less uniform plasma at

231
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:11,710
a temperature of thousands of Kelvin, which is the

232
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:16,420
scale needed in order to keep all of those atoms

233
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:21,280
ionized of the electrons separate from the protons

234
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,340
and other other atomic nuclei.

235
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:28,600
And.

236
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,790
What that tells us is that.

237
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:38,120
Now, as the universe has expanded over the past

238
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,430
thirteen point eight billion years, the

239
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:44,330
temperature of this cosmic microwave background,

240
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:48,850
the. The leftover lights from the big bang that's

241
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:52,330
filling all points in the universe, its

242
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:57,580
temperature has gradually cooled. By much more

243
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:00,490
than 99 percent of its initial value.

244
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:08,450
Leaving us with just that few Kelvin temperature

245
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:10,280
left over and.

246
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:17,870
While. It is sort of intuitive to think that over

247
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:22,190
time, hot objects, can they be expected to to cool

248
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:26,220
down the fact that. The cosmic microwave

249
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:29,250
background is really part of the universe, rather

250
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,740
than an object sitting within the universe and

251
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:35,220
able to radiate energy in the form of heat or

252
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:40,110
light really means that its change in temperature

253
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:43,110
is a bit more subtle than just an object sitting

254
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:49,500
in some space cooling down by radiating thermal

255
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:53,360
electromagnetic radiation. This cosmic microwave

256
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,330
background really is that radiation and the real

257
00:18:56,330 --> 00:19:00,590
reason it has cooled is in fact precisely due to

258
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:04,370
the expansion of the universe over the thirteen

259
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:08,690
point eight billion years since the cosmic

260
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:10,670
microwave background was formed. What what has

261
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:16,920
happened is that. The as the universe expands, the

262
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,830
wavelength of this background, light in the

263
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:23,460
universe is also being expanded in the same way,

264
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:27,090
which is we talked about last week corresponds to

265
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:32,160
lower energies and the correspondingly lower

266
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,420
temperatures coming from those longer wavelengths

267
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:42,960
moving towards the. Infrared. And in particular.

268
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:48,580
The peak wavelength of the cosmic microwave

269
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:52,090
background these days is around the scale of

270
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:54,560
millimeters as opposed to the hundreds of

271
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:59,900
nanometres, that is the main wavelength of the

272
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:02,800
visible light from the sun that we are able to see.

273
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,980
Which is. As might be expected from the name The

274
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:15,830
Microwave. Region of the electromagnetic radiation,

275
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:20,270
longer wavelengths moving into the infrared and

276
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,720
thermal frequencies and wavelength of a few

277
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:29,820
millimeters, which I believe is. The next. Figure

278
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:30,990
in.

279
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:38,990
In the quantum gases of bosun's notes where. This

280
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:45,340
millimeter scale is. Just about the central

281
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:50,320
frequency on the x axis of of this plot, which is

282
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:56,190
shown here in. Frequency of a particular.

283
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,630
Cyclical frequency rather than angular frequency,

284
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:08,820
so omega is two pi times. This F on the horizontal

285
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:11,760
axis here plotted in readers of Inver seconds,

286
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,050
which are also known as Herts.

287
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:20,000
And a frequency of several times, 10 to the 11

288
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:25,920
cycles per second. Corresponds to lights traveling

289
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,350
at the speed of light with a wavelength of about a

290
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:34,590
millimeter, let's see, 10 to the 11 would be a

291
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:40,050
hundred billion cycles per second. So this is the

292
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:40,740
overall.

293
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:43,570
Um.

294
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:48,940
Power density of the cosmic microwave background

295
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:52,930
averaged over all of the the sky is no longer

296
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:57,400
looking at the temperature fluctuations, focusing

297
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,200
on the overall measurements that can be carried

298
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:04,550
out quite precisely to the point that the. The

299
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:09,710
size of the squares in this figure showing the the

300
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:11,240
data are.

301
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:18,920
Generous estimates of the overall uncertainties in

302
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:21,580
these observational measurements of the power

303
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,710
coming from the cosmic microwave background, all

304
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:27,830
of the stars and galaxies subtracted away as a

305
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:33,030
function of that frequency. Which is then fit to

306
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:37,110
the salad line is our plank distribution.

307
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:43,950
And. In particular, we can see that there's really

308
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:47,560
an excellent agreement between all of these

309
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:51,910
data points and.

310
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:56,860
The overall Planck distribution, with its

311
00:22:56,860 --> 00:23:03,040
particular value of the temperature as as that

312
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:08,530
only free parameter, so it's to. Remind ourselves

313
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:14,370
of what this election is. Which I can write either

314
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:18,810
in terms of that angular frequency Omega or the

315
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:20,190
frequency F, which is.

316
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:28,560
Let me go over to pie. I prefer to work in terms

317
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:32,020
of the angular frequency omega just to. Keep the

318
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:34,270
factors of supply under control.

319
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,020
We have.

320
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:44,500
Plant distribution, given in terms of Omega cubed

321
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:51,010
over E to the each of our Omega over to. Minus one

322
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:54,100
in that fit to the single parameter of the

323
00:23:54,100 --> 00:24:01,760
temperature. To these data then. Gives the.

324
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:04,860
Bellevue, that was.

325
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:10,000
Published along with this plot from all the way

326
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,530
back in 1990, this was one of the first

327
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:18,670
measurements of the temperature of the cosmic

328
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:22,800
microwave background radiation. Which.

329
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:31,910
Measured it to. Just a few percent precision, so

330
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:35,720
two point seventy four plus minus zero point zero

331
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:43,150
six Kelvin. And in the 30 years since those

332
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:45,820
measurements were carried out, they've become much

333
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:48,430
more precise by many orders of magnitude, which in

334
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:53,170
turn allows a check of the age of the universe

335
00:24:53,440 --> 00:25:00,070
simply by figuring out how long it. Needs to have

336
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:04,660
been in order for the cosmic microwave background,

337
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:06,880
initially formed at a high temperature of

338
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:11,530
thousands of Kelvin to have decreased to the two

339
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:15,610
point seventy five Kelvin that we observe in the

340
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:16,290
present day.

341
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:32,670
Applause Just to check if any questions have come

342
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:36,420
in while you've been going through that. Bit about

343
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:38,670
the cosmic microwave background, because there's

344
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:43,980
one. Final thing I want to say about the cosmic

345
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:46,620
microwave background as a bit of a further

346
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:49,260
supplement that is mentioned in the notes without

347
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:54,390
going into detail, which is that the cosmic

348
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:56,100
microwave background is.

349
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:03,820
One of the strongest sources for. Our strongest

350
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:08,630
sources of evidence that we have for the existence

351
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:11,900
and other properties of dark matter.

352
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:19,810
And this is the figure we want to take look at in

353
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:23,770
the context of dark matter, because the evidence

354
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:25,660
for dark matter from the cosmic microwave

355
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:29,490
background is coming. Through a bit more involved

356
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,600
calculations than we're doing in this module, and

357
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,320
in particular, we have to take into account the

358
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:45,310
interactions between dark matter and. This the the

359
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:51,980
plasma of photons, light radiation and all the

360
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:55,520
other particles in existence in the early stages

361
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,620
of the universe on the cosmic microwave background

362
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:01,710
was formed. And carrying out those sorts of

363
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:07,400
calculations. Allows. Allows us to predict.

364
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:13,940
Not only the. Energy profile following the Planck

365
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:17,100
distribution that we were able to get from the

366
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:20,880
simple, not interacting photon gas, but also the

367
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:24,870
overall patterns of the fluctuations in the

368
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:26,850
temperature for the effective temperature shown

369
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:31,100
here, where. I should have mentioned when we were

370
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:35,240
looking at this figure that we can do these sorts

371
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:39,350
of fits of data to the plate distribution for

372
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:45,590
individual points in the empty sky show.

373
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:51,750
In this picture here and use those facts to

374
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,500
determine the temperature of the cosmic microwave

375
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:59,970
background coming precisely from that point in the

376
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:06,140
sky. So that's how the temperature. And in

377
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:09,230
particular, the fluctuations being shown here is

378
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:09,830
determined.

379
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,010
And what we would be able to predict from

380
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:20,570
computing the interactions between photons and in

381
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:25,190
a matter of ordinary matter that interacts

382
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:28,760
directly with light in the way that we are used to

383
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:31,100
in every day, as well as dark matter, which is

384
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:35,930
transparent and invisible to heat and lights and.

385
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:40,920
And the other. Experimental tools that we have

386
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:44,310
available in our laboratories on Earth carrying

387
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:48,940
out those calculations of those interactions leads

388
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:54,010
to predictions for how these regions of. Higher

389
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:56,950
and lower temperature photons and the cosmic

390
00:28:56,950 --> 00:29:00,730
microwave background are distributed around the

391
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:07,180
sky and. The usual way of presenting that sort of

392
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,590
data about.

393
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:16,100
The characteristics of. How likely we are if we

394
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:21,980
are in some hot patch of the sky to find another

395
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:25,670
hot patch as opposed to a cold patch, some

396
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:29,540
particular distance away in the sky. So because.

397
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:33,640
This is a three dimensional spherical shell

398
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:37,840
projected onto a two dimensional page, the

399
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:42,820
distance between. Those two passes is a measure of

400
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:46,750
an angular separation in the sky and the

401
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:51,960
measurement of. How much the temperature in one

402
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:56,250
place in the sky is correlated with another place,

403
00:29:56,260 --> 00:30:02,050
a certain angle away. Is the usual way that all of

404
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:06,640
the information in these measurements of the

405
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:10,850
cosmic microwave background can be reduced to just

406
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:15,010
a simple plot like this, which is. A relatively

407
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:20,950
old one from 2006, so the data have become much

408
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:22,300
more precise since then.

409
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:27,170
But this plot is nice because it illustrates how

410
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:33,130
the. The quantity being plotted vertically, which,

411
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:37,550
again, this program is not, let me draw on it, how

412
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:41,530
that is being shown as a function of an angular

413
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:46,480
scale labeled on the upper horizontal axis of this

414
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:46,960
plotts.

415
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:53,840
Flooded in particular logarithmically. Though the

416
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:58,950
vertical axis is an ordinary. Ordinary scale, so

417
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:02,130
this is a similar logarithmic plot and what is

418
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:07,750
shown on. The bottom horizontal axis is the

419
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:11,440
conversion of those angular scales in what's

420
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:17,090
called a a multiple expansion where. If we go back

421
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:25,270
to. This figure. Here is a simple dipole or.

422
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:31,040
What these polls correspond to is essentially.

423
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:39,440
Dividing up the the overall sky into some number

424
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:44,900
of. Of pieces or sectors that we can start with,

425
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:48,650
say, a dipole, which is just looking at dividing

426
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:56,010
the sky into two pieces. Which can freely take any

427
00:31:56,010 --> 00:32:00,690
orientation in this representation of the data and

428
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:04,920
seeing just how much how strongly those two pieces

429
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:08,190
are correlated with each other. And similarly for

430
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:12,600
Waterfall's dividing the sky into four pieces,

431
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:18,780
octopods dividing it into eight and so on, with

432
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:24,270
any possible orientation that leads to looking at

433
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:28,830
smaller scale fluctuations between those different

434
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:33,640
regions. So that's the connection shown here

435
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:39,280
between this so-called multiple moment and angular

436
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:42,520
scale where they see being plotted on the vertical

437
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:48,340
axis is a measure of that correlation between the

438
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:51,490
high and low temperature fluctuations at those

439
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:56,540
corresponding scales. And the data points are the

440
00:32:56,540 --> 00:33:01,900
measurements that can be. Taken and extracted from.

441
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:07,460
Data going into those temperature fluctuation

442
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,220
pictures that we were that are in the notes and

443
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:15,630
we're flipping back and forth between. In the sort

444
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:18,720
of British curve that is overlaid on top of them

445
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,870
is the prediction of the much more complicated

446
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:25,620
calculation with something like six parameters of.

447
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:31,780
Exactly what sort of temperature fluctuations we

448
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:35,320
would expect on any given scale, following from

449
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:39,040
that calculation of how the photons of the cosmic

450
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:45,910
microwave background are. Interacting with all of

451
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:49,610
the the matter in the universe, both. Visible,

452
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:54,400
luminous matter like atoms. And all of the

453
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:57,700
materials that we're familiar with, as well as

454
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:02,520
these potentially dark matter. And in particular,

455
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:06,060
where dark matter comes into this calculation,

456
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:13,720
though, sorry that I can't draw. Drawn onto. On

457
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:18,150
this picture, but the amount of dark matter is

458
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:22,380
most clearly seen in the relative heights of the

459
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:27,590
second and third peaks around this multiple moment,

460
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,570
five hundred and eight hundred, respectively,

461
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:34,530
angular scales of point four degrees versus about

462
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:36,840
point to five degrees where?

463
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:41,990
The the dark matter is the main reason that that

464
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:48,850
third. Peek in this plot is as large or as high

465
00:34:48,970 --> 00:34:52,180
vertically as the second piece, which is easier to

466
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:53,950
see in a slightly more recent

467
00:34:56,470 --> 00:35:00,940
figure here. I can zoom in just a bit. So this is

468
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:03,910
putting a little bit more recent data from two

469
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:06,940
thousand nine rather than two thousand six.

470
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,750
Slightly different scales, but still that same

471
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:15,130
correlation between the temperature fluctuations

472
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:17,890
of the cosmic microwave background at different

473
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:22,570
angular scales in the sky. And here that data is

474
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:27,310
being fit to two different predictions in two

475
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:33,340
different calculations shown by a dotted line and

476
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:37,900
a solid line. Where the cell phone line is what

477
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:40,870
would be predicted if there were no dark matter in

478
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:45,810
the universe. And the dotted line is the

479
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:52,350
prediction if if there is dark matter and. We can

480
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:58,200
take away from this plot is that the data really

481
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:01,260
demand the existence of dark matter in a

482
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:04,560
particular, we can see that in that third peak,

483
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:08,640
around 800 or L equals eight hundred and eight

484
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,610
hundred multiple moments on the horizontal axis,

485
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:16,860
which is where the difference between the dotted

486
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:20,830
and solid curves is most significant and easiest

487
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:26,560
to see. There is a much better description of the

488
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:31,480
data being provided by the hypothesis of dark

489
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:37,030
matter, which is just one piece of evidence

490
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:41,320
establishing the existence of dark matter, though

491
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:45,250
possibly the the most solid piece of evidence and

492
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:50,660
the evidence that is. Most difficult to to get

493
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:54,740
around by supposing that gravity might behave

494
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:58,490
differently than than we observe, which is an

495
00:36:58,490 --> 00:37:01,940
argument that was carried out in the 80s and 90s

496
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:05,600
when the existence of dark matter was first being

497
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:09,110
established. So that is.

498
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:14,550
The connection of the cosmic microwave background

499
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:19,800
and of and the work we are doing on quantum gases

500
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:25,830
of photons to. Some hot topics in modern physics,

501
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:32,020
like the. Existence of dark matter. Pause again

502
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:35,980
briefly just to check if any questions have come

503
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:38,500
in, what we've gone through, that which does get

504
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,130
us through.

505
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:48,750
All of the. Photon gas material from the from week

506
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:49,830
eight in the module.

507
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:01,840
And.

508
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:08,890
Since let's see, I'm looking at the time and not

509
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:13,600
seeing questions, and I think there is time that

510
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,140
we can.

511
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:22,230
If you just get into a bit about fermions, the end

512
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:27,510
of today and even before that, there's one last

513
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:30,690
topic that I was tempted to include in the

514
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:36,870
materials for for the module, but left out because

515
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:41,830
it is, again, a. A more complicated calculation,

516
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:44,170
though, possibly a more interesting one than the

517
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:49,320
photon gas, which is what happens if we have. Non

518
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:53,370
relativistic gases of those zones, and in

519
00:38:53,370 --> 00:38:57,120
particular at low temperatures where those non

520
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:59,940
relativistic gases would differ from their

521
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:03,210
behavior, would differ from the classical case

522
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:07,230
that we considered back in in week four before the

523
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:10,140
break. And.

524
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:17,520
There's really a fascinating phenomenon that

525
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:23,190
occurs in. Non relativistic losen gases at low

526
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:26,670
temperature at the cost of a much more complicated

527
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:31,050
calculation, when we are not able to approximate

528
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:35,130
the chemical potential as varnishing and have to

529
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:40,500
carry out the full calculation of inaugural's

530
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:45,570
mustard gas with a a non-zero chemical potential.

531
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:49,380
This is this phenomenon is known as those Einstein

532
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:53,550
carbonisation, as the name suggests. It follows

533
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:56,790
from those Einstein statistics and was first

534
00:39:57,210 --> 00:40:00,690
predicted by Einstein building on the work of

535
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:05,100
those in the 1920s. And it took a good 70 years

536
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:09,390
for technology to advance sufficiently to get

537
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:11,490
temperatures low enough that both Einstein

538
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:17,040
condensation could be observed. Experimentally in

539
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,290
a an atomic physics lab.

540
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:24,600
And that was very promptly rewarded with the Nobel

541
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:31,140
Prize in 2001. And this video that I will try to.

542
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:34,620
Broadcast over Zoome will see.

543
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:39,700
How it's picked up and transmitted, but that video

544
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:46,610
is. Illustration of what's going on with those and

545
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:51,900
condensation. Just lasting about a minute and

546
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:52,440
showing.

547
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:58,180
Both the quantize energy levels and their

548
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:04,540
occupation numbers as or for a gas of those arms

549
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:08,890
and how those occupation numbers tend to depend on

550
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:14,440
the temperature when we have a non relativistic.

551
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:18,500
Relation between the energy and momentum of these

552
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:23,130
particles. And as the temperature lowers,

553
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:27,870
gradually, the energy levels that the bosons are

554
00:41:27,870 --> 00:41:32,940
able to populate become a lower and lower and

555
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:36,810
eventually at very low temperatures. All of this

556
00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:41,010
goes on to form a new state of matter, all

557
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:44,730
populating that lowest energy level and behaving.

558
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:49,760
As a single collective quantum wave, as

559
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,690
illustrated here.

560
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:58,100
So sorry to add, there is the link where that full

561
00:41:58,110 --> 00:42:01,980
video can be found, and hopefully it wasn't too

562
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:07,740
distracting for me to talk over the subtitles that

563
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:12,850
it was showing from the. And so how to get out of

564
00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:18,340
that full screen? And back to another window.

565
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:24,780
So what are the so those kind of candidates have

566
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:31,750
many remarkable features. I'll just highlight. To

567
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:39,020
one of which being that. That transition from the

568
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:44,210
gas of not interacting particles, the sort of

569
00:42:44,210 --> 00:42:46,910
ideal gas that we've been considering through this

570
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:51,260
module, that makes all the calculations especially

571
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:55,430
simple when that gas of separate nondrinking

572
00:42:55,430 --> 00:43:01,110
particles changes to a. Single collective

573
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:04,380
wavefunction that really is what's known as a

574
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:08,190
phase transition, a change in the state of matter

575
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:11,820
of those particles, sort of similar to water

576
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:15,210
changing into ice. And this is reflected by.

577
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:22,080
Discontinuities and non Atlantis's in quantities

578
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:27,300
like the heat capacity, which is shown here in so

579
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:29,970
is David Tonguç lecture notes that go through the

580
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:33,000
more complicated calculation of the density of

581
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,460
states that has to be carried out.

582
00:43:37,570 --> 00:43:41,020
In order to predict this sort of behavior, but the.

583
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:47,200
The cusp of the peak that is shown in the heat

584
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:51,220
capacity at this critical temperature, T.C., is

585
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:54,820
the characteristic feature of a phase transition,

586
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:58,120
which we're going to get into on this week. But

587
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:01,390
next week after the bank holiday and usually phase

588
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:06,450
transitions require interactions between. The

589
00:44:06,450 --> 00:44:08,820
particles in the system, those are some

590
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:12,690
condensation being really one of the unique

591
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:18,030
systems in which a non interacting theory is able

592
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:20,790
to show with this sort of phase transition. I can

593
00:44:20,790 --> 00:44:22,620
also point out that at high temperatures in this

594
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:27,660
plot, as we go off to the right, which can't draw

595
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:28,110
on.

596
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:33,530
This window either see that the heat capacity

597
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:39,260
approaches, that three halves end, we computed for

598
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:40,340
the.

599
00:44:42,810 --> 00:44:46,530
The classical unrealistic gas in week for.

600
00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:52,200
And yet the last thing to say about those I

601
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:56,190
conversation is that while it was a real.

602
00:44:57,790 --> 00:45:02,980
Technological breakthrough in in the mid 90s very

603
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:06,700
quickly became a routine experimental setup to

604
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:11,140
create a Bose Einstein condensate and use it for

605
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:16,360
all sorts of other purposes as a tool in ultra low

606
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:20,530
temperature physics labs, and in particular, a lot

607
00:45:20,530 --> 00:45:23,680
of the applications of those those Einstein

608
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:26,110
concepts that are being created now in hundreds of

609
00:45:26,110 --> 00:45:32,740
labs around the world is to serve as the basis for

610
00:45:33,070 --> 00:45:35,830
for quantum computers or quantum simulating

611
00:45:35,830 --> 00:45:39,370
machines, where those Einstein concept is created

612
00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:42,130
and then it's quantum properties are manipulated

613
00:45:42,130 --> 00:45:46,090
in order to do calculations and simulations.

614
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:52,340
So I guess, as usual, that discussion will

615
00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:55,610
supplement on both our side conversation went on

616
00:45:56,330 --> 00:46:01,000
longer than. I expected so I'm going to to wrap up

617
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:05,680
there and Thursday will be quantum is a fermions

618
00:46:06,070 --> 00:46:12,110
from the start. And this is the last call for

619
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,530
questions today.

620
00:46:17,770 --> 00:46:20,750
And if there aren't any of the next ministers who

621
00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:24,250
will shut down the zoo meeting, extract that

622
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:27,070
recording and come back in about 10 minutes for

623
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:28,570
today's office hours.
