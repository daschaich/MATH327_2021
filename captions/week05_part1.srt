00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:05,070
Hello and welcome back to a statistical physics.

2
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:10,690
This is the first video for the week five material,

3
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:14,920
and I will continue experimenting with the format

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,670
of these videos, in particular continuing that

5
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:24,560
screen share. And when I first tried this. Last

6
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,040
week, it seemed as though it was hard to keep the

7
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:31,640
overview separate from the the take away and wrap

8
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,570
up summary of the key learning outcomes, so tried

9
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:39,680
to just do a single pass through the material for

10
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,920
this week, both putting it into context and

11
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:48,320
emphasizing what to take away from it. And we'll

12
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,110
see how that works and if it's worth continuing

13
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:54,290
for the remainder of the term. Still aiming for

14
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,770
the same amount of time in these videos. So that's

15
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:03,800
not too much of the written material is duplicated

16
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,480
redundantly. So as I said, read five is our last

17
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:12,080
week looking at the canonical ensemble, the

18
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:15,440
probability space that fixes the temperature and

19
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,950
the particle number. And as we saw last week, in

20
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:24,830
some contexts, the volume is also a key parameter,

21
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:28,640
a control parameter of the canonical ensemble. And

22
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,270
this week we continue applying those canonical

23
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:35,270
tools to look at thermodynamic cycles and in

24
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:39,140
particular cycles that act as engines or

25
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:44,810
refrigerators. And this begins quite directly from

26
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,810
where we left off last week, where we defined the

27
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:53,870
thermodynamic pressure as the response of the

28
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:57,020
average internal energy to an adiabatic change in

29
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:00,200
the volume adiabatic, meaning the entropy is fixed,

30
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:07,760
finding the ideal gas law and motivating that

31
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:12,230
definition of pressure by thinking about squeezing

32
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:16,280
or compressing a system of an ideal gas, which

33
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,380
then brings in a connection between pressure and

34
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:24,680
force, which may be familiar to those of you who

35
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,860
have encountered Newtonian mechanics before, where

36
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:31,370
pressure is just the force exerted per unit area

37
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:35,330
of a surface. And that is precisely the connection

38
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:39,440
that we begin by deriving this relation between

39
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:44,150
the thermodynamic pressure as the response of a

40
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:48,200
probabilistic system to the idea of a force acting

41
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:53,930
on some area. And this relies on the role of the

42
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:57,710
volume as a control parameter in the ensemble.

43
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:03,270
That volume is providing the area. Where?

44
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,720
Skip ahead quickly to this illustration, we have a

45
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,070
picture of ideal gas particles in some container

46
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,760
where one wall of that container is a movable

47
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:22,490
piston with that area, A, which we can push in to

48
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:25,280
compress the gas or pull out to expand the gas by

49
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,420
applying an appropriate force. And that process

50
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:33,740
changing the volume. As we saw, that raises the

51
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:37,580
energy of the gas and if it's done idiomatically,

52
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:41,930
then the change in energy raising, if it's

53
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:45,800
compressed and falling, if it's expanded, that

54
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:49,310
change in energy is given by the work done by this

55
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:52,760
force. Another concept from the 17th century,

56
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:57,500
Newtonian mechanics. The work is the product. The

57
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,980
inner product of the force got it into the

58
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:05,330
displacements it causes, both in three dimensions.

59
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:08,270
So a simple example you can work through, if this

60
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:10,640
is unfamiliar, is thinking about an object falling

61
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,520
from a height under the force of the Earth's

62
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,100
gravity, which is directed downward. The object

63
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,860
falls downward so that work is just a simple

64
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:22,880
product of the force times. The light falls that

65
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,180
changes the energy from, say, zero if it starts at

66
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:32,450
rest to a classic result for the momentum or the

67
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:35,330
velocity of a particle that falls some distance

68
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:40,970
from rest. In this example, with the movable

69
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:44,720
piston, the force is again directed in the

70
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,060
parallel, in the same direction as the

71
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:51,080
displacement it causes. So the work it produces is

72
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:55,250
positive, and that corresponds to a change, a

73
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:58,490
positive change in the internal energy coming from

74
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:03,140
a decrease in the volume. And we can connect the

75
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:05,630
thermodynamic definition of the pressure from last

76
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:12,050
week to the usual force per unit area that comes

77
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:15,790
from the 17th century. And.

78
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:23,370
More generally, the work is still given by that

79
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:26,080
pressure times the change in the volume with that

80
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:26,910
negative sign.

81
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:33,410
Correctly mapping the decreasing volume to an

82
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:38,180
increasing internal energy, but if the entropy is

83
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,790
allowed to change, then there is another possible

84
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:45,110
way to introduce changes to the energy without

85
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:49,850
changing the volume or doing any work in this

86
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:54,350
simple relation generalizes to an integration when

87
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,810
the pressure is not constant. Typically, as we

88
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:00,590
change the volume, we change the pressure that is

89
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,920
familiar from trying to say, compressible doing

90
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:06,590
the. As the volume could squeeze, the pressure

91
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:09,740
gets larger and the total work done has to be

92
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,560
integrated over that changing pressure as a

93
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,250
function of volume. But if we suppose that the

94
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,280
volume stays constant so that no work is done, W

95
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:22,250
equals zero. It's still possible to change the

96
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:25,250
internal energy of the gas, which we actually

97
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,590
looked at all the way back in the micro canonical

98
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:28,760
ensemble and week to.

99
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:36,290
The internal energy is related to heat and the

100
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:40,160
economical ensemble, the exchange of heat with the

101
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,630
system's surroundings.

102
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,680
So from last week for an ideal gas, we found that

103
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:52,060
the average internal energy is just given by the

104
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:58,450
temperature. So even if we. Keep the volume fixed

105
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:01,330
so that no work is done, we can increase that

106
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:05,640
temperature by adding some heat. And the process

107
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:09,510
of increasing the temperature we expect since the

108
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:14,610
energy changes for you is zero, the entropy must

109
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:18,210
also change in order to be consistent with the

110
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:23,390
work in the previous section and. Running through

111
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:28,330
that calculation. Produces a change in the entropy

112
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:30,670
that is directly proportional to the change in the

113
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:33,730
energy, and it is precisely that.

114
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,700
Change in the energy that we define as the heat in

115
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:42,810
terms of the temperature and the change in entropy.

116
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:47,880
And just as for work, this heat is positive when

117
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:51,510
the internal energy of the gas increases, negative

118
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:55,860
when it decreases, and if the temperature changes

119
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,920
in that process, we need to express the

120
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,290
temperature as a function of the entropy,

121
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:05,930
inverting the usual relation that we looked at

122
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:08,890
even a couple of weeks ago. Or the canonical

123
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:13,330
ensemble and integrates over the change of the

124
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:15,250
entropy in this process.

125
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,250
And the one last thing I'll say before.

126
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:24,550
Stopping this video and starting a new one to keep

127
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:27,040
them relatively bite sized is that.

128
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:33,800
This relation between heat exchange and the change

129
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:38,480
in entropy gives us some important physical

130
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,510
intuition for what it means for a process to be

131
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:44,420
adiabatic. Remember, adiabatic means that the

132
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:48,080
entropy does not change. And this equation. Sixty

133
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,110
five. The definition of heat then means that no

134
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:57,170
heat is exchanged due to the constant entropy. So

135
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:59,720
in adiabatic process is one that does not exchange

136
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:03,170
heat, which we can interpret as typically being a

137
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:06,080
process that occurs quickly enough that there's no

138
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,830
time for heat to be exchanged between the system

139
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:13,430
and its surroundings. In other words, adiabatic

140
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:18,710
processes are fast, and the opposite extreme is to

141
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:24,950
consider a slow process where enough heat is

142
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:28,970
exchanged at every step in the process to keep the

143
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:32,600
temperature fixed in verbalised with the

144
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:36,640
surrounding systems. Where the system's

145
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,630
surroundings, I should say, that fixed temperature

146
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:44,710
is known as isothermal situation or nicer thermal

147
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:48,550
process, and that is the opposite exchange of what

148
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:51,520
happens when changes in the system are done very

149
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,970
slowly and the system is allowed to recalibrates

150
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:59,560
to its constant temperature thermal reservoir at

151
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,710
each step in that process. And those real

152
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:06,280
processes exist in between those two extremes,

153
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:11,650
usually closer to the adiabatic limit and. With

154
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:16,650
that, I will. Pause the recording and pick up with

155
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:21,900
applying these ideas of heat and work to look at

156
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,450
bona fide thermodynamic cycles.
