1
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:07,020
OK, I'll get the recording underway for today.

2
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:11,700
A small crowd early in Liverpool on a rather bright

3
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:17,160
Monday morning to keep that shade closed or rather

4
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:22,350
I should probably just share the screen to hop

5
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:23,070
over to

6
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:27,850
getting started with some

7
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:36,000
quick logistical topics, and unless more people

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,450
show up in the next few minutes, we'll probably

9
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:47,320
just leave the usual input for. Questions or other

10
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:51,070
feedback from those of you who are on here

11
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:52,510
synchronously?

12
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:01,710
Rather than going through a lot of polls, the same

13
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:05,730
number of folks, you can just feel free to speak

14
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:09,680
up instead through. Zoom out of the chat window or

15
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:14,690
out loud and to give you a few minutes for any

16
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:19,290
initial immediate questions about. Things that are

17
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:23,640
on your mind or have come up before in the past

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,320
meetings mentioned that there have been some not

19
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,570
necessarily logistical updates, but logistical

20
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:35,790
elaborations since our last meeting where there is.

21
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:40,890
Posted now there are posted, detailed instructions

22
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:44,790
for the final exam, which should also now be on

23
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:47,520
the calendar for.

24
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:55,660
Or on the module through canvas, so no need to go

25
00:01:55,660 --> 00:02:00,560
through those. Now you can read them offline, but.

26
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:05,020
You get in touch, if anything seems problematic in

27
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:08,890
terms of the scheduling or other aspects of those

28
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:11,530
instructions, which I imagine are pretty standard

29
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:13,330
for all of your molecule's.

30
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:23,110
And a quick check is. Not showing any immediate

31
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:28,780
questions, so we can pick up where we. Left off

32
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:32,870
last week, and I think with today and Thursday,

33
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:37,150
you might be mixing together a bit of the material

34
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:43,740
from week 10 and 11. But starting with looking at

35
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,240
some of the.

36
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:53,320
The reason that the easy model has been so widely

37
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,440
used and so successful as a model for everything

38
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:00,070
from neural networks to feral magnetism, and that

39
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:02,380
has to do with the.

40
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:07,130
The phase transition that it exhibits as a

41
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:10,670
consequence of having these interactions between

42
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:14,870
nearest neighbor spins on this type cubic lattice

43
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:17,850
that defines that some over an interstate repair.

44
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:21,710
So you went through all of that last week? I won't

45
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,660
reiterate it unless there are questions about it.

46
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:33,570
But instead, just point out the door to limits

47
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:38,610
where we can make some reasonable approximations

48
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:43,050
and analytic pen and paper solutions to this

49
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:46,170
partition function that's in full generality

50
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:50,460
involves the sum over all possible microstates in

51
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:53,760
this case, all possible configurations of these

52
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,050
spin's pointing either up or down where there's

53
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:02,040
set in the external magnetic field, two to zero.

54
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:04,230
For the time being, there will be no distinction

55
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:08,970
between up and down in a symmetry between those

56
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:14,280
two directions. And generally that sum with a tiny

57
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,090
system here of about a thousand spins, we have

58
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:21,390
about ten to the power. Three hundred ten terms

59
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:25,320
counting all of the terms in the exponential as

60
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:29,670
well as all the exponential in the sum over spin

61
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:33,390
configurations, which is not something that can be

62
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:37,680
solved in full generality, at least in more than

63
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,910
two dimensions. What we can do is consider a

64
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:45,510
simplified limit. Of either high or low

65
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:49,530
temperature, which is exactly what we did back in

66
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:54,600
week reality, that was looking at the. Entropy and

67
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:58,430
internal energy for systems of distinguishable

68
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:01,130
spins like we have here in the latter, as well as

69
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:07,430
indistinguishable spins in a gas where the

70
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:11,340
individual spins, can't be. Distinguished from

71
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:18,040
each other and saw that. In both the low and high

72
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:21,250
temperature limits in the not on track, in case we

73
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,080
had an exact expression that we were able to

74
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,530
expand in a tower series in some small quantity,

75
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:31,450
but for looking at just the phases of the system,

76
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,230
the qualitatively different ways that these

77
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:39,640
collections of degrees of freedom can behave

78
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,010
depending on the control parameter of the

79
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:45,370
temperature with no magnetic field, we can just

80
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:49,450
focus our attention on the the very leading term,

81
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:53,890
the some limit for the partition function, which

82
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,550
when we have infinite temperature, that equals

83
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:02,560
zero. That partition function just becomes the sum

84
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:08,830
over all of those spin configurations of the two

85
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,660
Beita times, something finite. Which would be

86
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:19,890
desirable is just going to be to the zero, so a

87
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:27,580
factor of one seemed over to to the end times. So

88
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:33,730
as mentioned here, this is exactly what we had, I

89
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:36,280
think, in week two for this system, in the micro

90
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,940
canonical setting with energy equals to zero.

91
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,220
Every spin configuration appears with an equal

92
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,340
probability if it has to be won over the total

93
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:50,580
number of microstates in order for all of those

94
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:54,330
probabilities to add up to one condition on.

95
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,950
What it means to be a probability.

96
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,030
And.

97
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:10,730
Here, where it seems as though the energy is now

98
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:13,460
invisible compared to the very high temperatures

99
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:16,850
that we have, that's motivation to introduce

100
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:20,690
another way of describing and categorizing these

101
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:25,250
systems to the magnetization, which is just the

102
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:28,730
difference between the number of appointing spins,

103
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:33,180
minus the number of downvoting spins. Divided by

104
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:36,000
the renormalize by the total number of spins to

105
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,330
get some equality between zero and one, and the

106
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:44,370
reason for the absolute value sign here is to.

107
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:56,520
Distinguish between. Cases where. We might have a

108
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:00,130
large number of. Know when we are doing the

109
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:03,610
ensemble average, looking at the expectation value,

110
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:07,810
because there is that symmetry between appointing

111
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:10,090
spins and down to that expense with that vanishing

112
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:16,160
magnetic field. The. If if we did not have an

113
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,670
absolute value that ensemble average defining the

114
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:23,390
expectation value would sum over equal

115
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:27,110
contributions from, say, all of the spins pointing

116
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:30,930
up or all of the spins pointing down. And that

117
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:33,540
would give obviously equal and opposite

118
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:36,210
manifestations without that absolute value sign,

119
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:39,690
which in the expectation value that some with an

120
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:45,450
equal probability would simply. Vanish. So, you

121
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:47,940
know, we'll see. That's the expectation value is

122
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:51,570
necessary in order for this quantity to.

123
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:57,760
Very concretely distinguish between the two phases

124
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:59,770
in the first phase that we're looking at here, the

125
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:04,690
high temperature of things is distinguished by an

126
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:07,330
equal probability for every microbe state that we

127
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:12,950
just arrived and. The expectation values then are

128
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:19,880
going to be controlled by the multiplicity of any

129
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:23,900
given any given macro state and given the

130
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:29,090
distribution of spins into these upward pointing

131
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:33,350
or downward pointing sets that give different

132
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:37,570
contributions to that magnetization. So if all the

133
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:40,480
microstates are equally weighted, then.

134
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:44,880
The probability of landing in any of those

135
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:49,310
microstates is just given, by the way, the

136
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,800
probability of picking up a particular number of

137
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,240
upward pointing or down reporting spins is just

138
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,890
the number of possibilities out of out of the

139
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,080
total number and of the systems that we choose,

140
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:09,960
say, and plus of them to be pointing up, which is

141
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,840
just the usual binomial factor that's been popping

142
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:19,140
up all term and for large numbers of spins, even

143
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:23,910
for. You tiny systems of tens or hundreds of spins.

144
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:30,870
This binomial factor is. Dominantly peaks right

145
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:36,360
around the sort of midpoints where we are choosing

146
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,510
roughly half of the spin's to be pointing up and

147
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:41,700
half of them to be pointing down, there's a

148
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:45,870
factorial preference for that setting, which when?

149
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:50,740
The number of upward in now reporting spins is

150
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:52,990
approximately equal, we end up with a

151
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:57,580
magnetization from their difference that is

152
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:02,320
approximately zero and in fact goes to zero in the

153
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,870
limit of an infinite number of spins. That's

154
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:08,620
called the thermodynamic limit, where all the

155
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:11,080
approximations that we would be making for a

156
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:15,550
finite number of spins becomes become formally

157
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:21,760
exact. When we have that infinite number, it no

158
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:28,300
longer becomes. A. An approximate equality between

159
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:31,510
upward in our brain spins, but actually the exact

160
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:33,430
equivalents in that sort of damage limit.

161
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:39,580
So the magnetization is going to zero in debt

162
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:43,730
limit of high temperatures. And not surprisingly,

163
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:47,420
it does something difference in the limit of low

164
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:51,040
temperatures. Which is.

165
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:01,740
I'm just debating whether or not to make this a

166
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:06,440
poll, so we have probably not enough people to.

167
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:12,260
It's really make that worthwhile. You want to.

168
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:17,370
Consider or see how the.

169
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:25,620
Low temperature. Limit behaves for the easy model.

170
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,960
And in this case, we have.

171
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,000
Low temperatures, correspondence, large penis, so

172
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,570
that the.

173
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:44,160
Partition function, which I. Have right here an

174
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,210
equation one 19, the negative signs in the energy

175
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:52,370
cancel out. So as beta gets larger, the

176
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,500
exponential factors in this partition function are

177
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:00,870
themselves becoming exponentially large so that

178
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:05,040
only the the lowest possible energies coming from

179
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,550
these nearest neighbor payers on our simplistic

180
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:12,630
lattice are going to dominate the system in this

181
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,070
low temperature limit.

182
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:23,760
And I suppose I will.

183
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:27,490
You know.

184
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:38,700
Do a quick check in with what is this ground state

185
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:42,000
energy on the page that we are currently looking

186
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,900
at, page one twenty.

187
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:49,470
Seeing that. The.

188
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:55,070
The probabilities now are no longer equal for all

189
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:58,490
microstates, but depend on the energy we have to

190
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:04,000
determine the the ground set energy policy and

191
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:07,400
that it will really dominate over the the first

192
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,370
excited state in this limit of of low temperatures.

193
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:12,680
And from that.

194
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:20,500
We'll be able to. Reach a conclusion or

195
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:24,430
approximation about the behavior of the

196
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:27,520
magnetization and the characteristics of this

197
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,150
phase.

198
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:31,280
And.

199
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:42,780
Like.

200
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:55,380
Had some issues with getting this whole activated

201
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:58,710
or deactivated, but it should now be running and I

202
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:04,860
see at least one response so far away, just a. A

203
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,140
little bit longer for.

204
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:12,350
Any further responses since it is still a small

205
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,560
crowd today?

206
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:00,650
And it's probably. Time just to quickly check out

207
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:04,370
what we have for that ground state energy.

208
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:10,890
When there's some disagreement between. The two

209
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:13,890
options are both involve the dimensionality, these

210
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:19,020
times, the number of sites and in the.

211
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:23,360
Way to.

212
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:29,380
Resolve that that balance would be to.

213
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,930
Note that.

214
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:40,690
The. The minimum energy is coming when.

215
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,660
All of these products have nearest neighbor spins

216
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:50,920
are they are either plus or minus one, depending

217
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:54,310
on whether those spins are aligned with each other

218
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:57,550
or a. a line in the aligned case. They're both

219
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:00,190
plus one and square the positive one where they're

220
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:03,310
both minus one square positive one. Whereas in the

221
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:06,730
Anticline case, one is positive, one is negative

222
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:10,030
in the overall product is negative. So with the

223
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:13,750
negative sign out front, you want all of these

224
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:16,350
nearest neighbor appears to be aligned and all

225
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:21,520
contributing a. Plus one in the sun, that becomes

226
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,870
a negative one with an overall negative sign. And

227
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:30,220
then gives us that smallest or most negative

228
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:35,630
possible value of that energy. In particular sum

229
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:39,170
over all those nearest neighbor pairs of plus or

230
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:43,720
minus one square. Which is then just counting the

231
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:47,760
number of nearest neighbor pairs that we. Figured

232
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:53,010
out last week was the number of sites, times D,

233
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:57,720
the dimensionality where that simple cubic lattice

234
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:02,090
every site has. Our nearest neighbours, both

235
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:07,190
forward and backward in each of the dimensions. So

236
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:13,160
the groups already switched back to that open.

237
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,930
Input for any questions that you want to send in

238
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:24,740
anonymously rather than through Tsou. These times

239
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:30,710
and is the the lowest energy corresponding to that

240
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:34,500
ground state that we define. You know, I believe

241
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:39,350
week three and then. You need to consider both the

242
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:43,570
first extended to energy as well as the number of.

243
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:48,400
Micro states that all have the.

244
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:52,800
The degenerate energy level corresponding either

245
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,050
to the underground state or the first excited

246
00:18:55,050 --> 00:19:00,120
state, so the ground that there are two. And he

247
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,770
generously of two, four of.

248
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:07,530
The different ways that all of the spins can be

249
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:10,710
aligned, either all pointing up or all pointing

250
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:11,190
down.

251
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,610
In the.

252
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:21,990
First, excited state corresponds to taking one of

253
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:27,660
the and spins in our system and flipping it so

254
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,310
that the.

255
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:37,120
Ground state energy that we had now is increased

256
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:42,370
by all of the links that.

257
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:49,360
Are connected to the site that was just flipped or

258
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,980
perhaps a more.

259
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:00,430
Thorough or direct way of going about this would

260
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:04,240
be to recognize that we're getting that same

261
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:08,080
contribution of a negative one from all of the

262
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:11,380
spin pairs that continue to be aligned, which is

263
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:18,000
all of those deeds and sites except for the. To do

264
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:21,890
links that are connected to the site that was

265
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:24,620
flipped and those Tuti links instead are

266
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:29,460
contributing with a positive sign to the energy.

267
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,230
So just rearranging the slightly the first excited

268
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:36,560
state energy. Is.

269
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:42,570
These times in dimensionality.

270
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:50,660
Minus four times the dimensionality, the. Which is

271
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:56,480
indeed a less negative energy than the.

272
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:03,300
The ground states by. That factor of four times

273
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,890
the dimensionality.

274
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:19,100
So. As the temperature. Becomes small. This energy

275
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,840
does not depend on the temperature and there will

276
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:25,220
be there for a constant exponential factor arising

277
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:28,700
from precisely that, for the difference between

278
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:32,630
the energy gap that we find earlier between the

279
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:36,350
ground, say, the first excited state there at the

280
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:41,390
same time be impossible spins that can be Flip's.

281
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:44,840
There will be two and microstates that all have

282
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:48,410
that first. Excited state energy level.

283
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:54,130
In the magnetization for each of those microstates

284
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:59,880
is. Very nearly the maximum magnetization, one

285
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,830
coming from the ground states with just this one

286
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:05,370
over and correction. So two competing effects of

287
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:10,830
end, both more micro states that can pull the

288
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,380
magnetization away from its maximum. But at the

289
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:16,260
same time, each of those microstates is pulling

290
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:21,120
only a one over and factor further away. So the

291
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:26,710
conclusion then is that as this bita. Is

292
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:31,380
sufficiently large. In the low temperature limit,

293
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:35,480
so just looking at the TotEx rather than the the

294
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:38,430
correction terms in a in an expansion in a small

295
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:42,650
parameter. The ground state will always dominate

296
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:46,010
the magnetization and we end up with that

297
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:49,100
expectation value approximately one and

298
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:53,060
approaching one in the thermodynamic limit of a

299
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:54,470
large number of.

300
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:57,810
Of Spin's.

301
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:00,410
And.

302
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:08,060
Another way of appreciating this is just to rather

303
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:11,510
than doing detailed mathematics, just to look at

304
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:12,860
pictures of.

305
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:21,460
Of how these. Source of microstates and the

306
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:27,340
different phases can. Can be distinguished from

307
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:30,420
each other and look different from each other.

308
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:36,190
Let's see if I'm able to draw in in this program

309
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:42,060
where. These pictures are all coming from one of

310
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:44,790
the textbooks in that list of references at the

311
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:47,880
start of the larger material, Dan Schroder's

312
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:51,420
introduction to thermal physics. This is the

313
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:55,500
representation of. Microstates of the easing model

314
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:58,500
in two dimensions, so just on a two dimensional

315
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:03,840
square. Where, say, the upward pointing spins are

316
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,660
being colored white down front spins are being

317
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:15,310
colored black and in each of these. Different

318
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:18,430
squares in this nine by nine grid, we're looking

319
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:19,000
at a.

320
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:24,020
Representative microstates from one of the

321
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:27,890
numerical calculations that was described in the

322
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:31,100
in the week 11 notes or kind of jumping around and

323
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,950
looking at numerical simulation of the using model

324
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:37,160
at the same time as we discuss the high and low

325
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,920
temperature limits where there are analytic

326
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:46,280
approximations that we can make. And. The top left

327
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,830
picture here, what's called the initial state,

328
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:53,040
which is where. These simulations are being

329
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:56,370
started because that is completely random, it

330
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,760
corresponds to selecting one of the microstates

331
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,400
with an equal probability for all the microstates.

332
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:07,530
So this is what we would get in that limit of T.

333
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:14,350
Going to infinitely high temperature. And it's

334
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:16,540
looking across that whole that whole first row

335
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:20,320
where the temperature is relatively large.

336
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:29,990
We see that I there's not too. Much difference,

337
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:33,870
not very different behavior in the sort of

338
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:37,560
microstates that that we are seeing if we jump

339
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:43,040
ahead to the bottom row. Where the temperature is

340
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:48,950
one one and a half or two relatively small can see

341
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:53,820
that in this case. Most of the spin's want to be

342
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:59,010
aligned with each other. Exactly the order phase

343
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:02,040
that we were talking about just now, where the

344
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,590
ground state of all of the is being aligned

345
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:07,590
becomes exponentially more likely as this

346
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:12,270
temperature T goes to zero. So at the bottom

347
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:16,530
center plot. There is.

348
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:25,950
The microchip there, which has only two spins,

349
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:29,310
pointing in in one of the two directions to light

350
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:33,240
colored spins and almost all of the spins colored

351
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:36,420
black awning in a single direction is pretty close

352
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:40,080
to the the ground state that we were getting.

353
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:44,140
Analytically, as an approximation, I should have

354
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:47,560
said at the start that these systems are, if you

355
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:50,710
count them, they're 20 by 20 lattices in two

356
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:58,140
dimensions, only four hundred sites. And. At the

357
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:00,480
very lowest temperature case shown here, t equals

358
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,350
one might look a bit surprising at first sight.

359
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:09,220
And what's really happened there is that the

360
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:13,200
temperature is so low that.

361
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:15,740
The.

362
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:23,970
It's an artifact of the Metropolis Rosenblatt's

363
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:26,240
teller algorithm that was used to produce these

364
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,300
these pictures where starting from a random

365
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:33,570
initial state, it can become exponentially slow to

366
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:36,870
reach the ground state if the temperature gets too

367
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:40,830
low. And that is because in order, what we see in

368
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:43,680
this lowest temperature flat is a roughly equal

369
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:47,070
balance between the number of upper 20 expands,

370
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:50,490
the number of downward spins all in separate

371
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:54,240
blocks with periodic boundary conditions sort of

372
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,940
wrapping around the top to the bottom. So there's

373
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:02,210
only a single light colored block. There and also

374
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:06,380
wrapping around each of the sides, creating that

375
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:09,950
tourists, so each of those white and black regions

376
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:17,280
is just a single region. And in order for one of

377
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:21,060
the to degenerate ground states to be chosen.

378
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:28,140
It would have to be one by one, the algorithm

379
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,700
would have to flip each of these.

380
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:36,470
Say WACHT spins to make them black, which becomes

381
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:40,760
exponentially hard when you have that one isolated.

382
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,630
Leks been up there, there's a very large

383
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:47,820
probability that that Laxton will want to be

384
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:50,370
flipped back to whites so that essentially we have

385
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:56,860
to separate Gladys's, each of them aligned. In.

386
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:01,820
Their own direction and the interface between them

387
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:05,660
can no longer change through this important

388
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:10,730
sampling algorithm just because the probability of

389
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:13,490
flipping a spin on the boundary is exponentially

390
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:14,150
suppressed.

391
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:26,640
So we can. Get even. A. A more detailed view of

392
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:32,720
what's going on here by. Looking at live some of

393
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:37,130
the sorts of simulations that you know of which

394
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:39,350
these are snapshots, maybe before I switch to that,

395
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:39,770
I'll just.

396
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:45,940
Say a little bit about the intermediate

397
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:49,600
temperatures, say this time around, two point five

398
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:55,790
in the center right. Figure here, something

399
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:58,820
interesting is going on on that while there is

400
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:07,170
still lots of domains of. White and in black since

401
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:11,550
and see the compared to the very high temperature

402
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:15,960
microstates shown above it, the domains where all

403
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:20,390
the spins are aligned are steadily growing. And

404
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:23,810
there's actually at the critical temperature,

405
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:28,790
which is where this four by 400 micro state

406
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:33,200
picture was taken and actually turn out to be

407
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:37,700
domain's of spin's, of all different sizes with

408
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:40,400
equal probability, lots of phenomenon that's

409
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:44,240
called percolation, where we can see if we look in

410
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,440
here and.

411
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:52,050
Turn on the Pentagon, there are small domain's of

412
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:57,570
black, just a few spins there, larger domain's and

413
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:01,260
obviously this big large I here that is mostly

414
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:01,740
black

415
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:07,170
is the sort of intermediate behavior that we get

416
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:09,750
in between the high-temperature with it where

417
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:15,160
there are. Very rapid fluctuations between up and

418
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,050
down pointing stands and the low temperature limit,

419
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:23,450
where there are few, if any, changes in the. In

420
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:24,590
the spin orientation.

421
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:27,510
Now, the.

422
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:35,300
I was doing the prelude for some of these videos,

423
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:38,720
which hopefully will come through in Zoome where?

424
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:45,090
These are this putting together a stream of the

425
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:47,100
snapshots at a fixed temperature.

426
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,730
Starting from one particular orientation now using

427
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:55,600
the colors, yellow and blue rather than black and

428
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,150
white, but showing in this case, this is for a

429
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:03,700
high temperature, how as we. Go through the system

430
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:05,860
with the Petropolis results, tell our algorithm

431
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:11,780
and propose. Spin flips with some probability that

432
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:14,240
a lot of those continue to happen, and I should

433
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:19,490
also say that this calculation or the simulation

434
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:25,970
is being done in a non-zero background field, that.

435
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:30,390
I believe is oriented in the in the yellow

436
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:36,530
direction, so that. At very high temperatures that

437
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:38,660
are there's a high temperature compared to that

438
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:41,810
exterminated field, you would not be able to.

439
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:48,190
To see how much effect of the electromagnetic

440
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:54,310
field, but if we look at. Low temperatures. Then

441
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:57,790
you're starting even from that all blue

442
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:58,900
microstates.

443
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:04,260
Even with the magnetic field encouraging alignment

444
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:09,750
in the yellow direction, it is hard for. Spins to

445
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:12,780
be flipped to that yellow direction, there's an

446
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:16,080
exponential penalty coming from the interaction

447
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:22,770
term with that low temperature. But eventually, a

448
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:28,770
few domains are able to form and start growing and

449
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:30,150
inside those domains.

450
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:36,820
There is. Contribution or the preferred

451
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:39,370
contribution to the energy from both having the

452
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:42,100
spins aligned, as well as having the alignment

453
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:45,250
with that yellow pointing external magnetic field

454
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:46,960
so that as.

455
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:52,970
The domain's slowly spread in the course of this

456
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:57,550
simulation. They are able to grow faster and

457
00:33:57,550 --> 00:34:00,700
faster until they dominate everything and it

458
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:05,200
becomes exponentially unlikely for any spins to be

459
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:09,640
flipped backward to. So the blue orientation.

460
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:15,240
So I think in just a few more seconds, this last

461
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:19,500
two blue domains will be swallowed by the low

462
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:23,040
temperature order to phase that.

463
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:28,930
Is the the only ground state in the presence of

464
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,090
this external magnetic field and.

465
00:34:34,410 --> 00:34:37,680
The try wasn't. Toward the end.

466
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:48,370
Where we can see what the order face looks like,

467
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:56,880
looks like in. Contrast to the disordered phase. A

468
00:34:57,010 --> 00:35:00,100
shot of the very high temperatures with it at

469
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:04,600
intermediate temperatures, we see that

470
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:10,620
intermediate behavior with. Larger domains that

471
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:14,780
still aren't able to. Spread all the way across

472
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:20,840
this Latisse. But are distinct from both that

473
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:22,880
ordered phase of the low temperature limit as well

474
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,940
as the. High-temperature phase where there are

475
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:30,510
more random fluctuations from site to site.

476
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:40,900
And as this just continues to run for its final

477
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:41,740
few seconds,

478
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:46,600
I'll just make the point that comes up in the week

479
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,680
11 notes that.

480
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:55,030
Even in. The you know, these small systems, I

481
00:35:55,030 --> 00:36:00,400
think the number of lattice points here is only

482
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,440
something like three thousand.

483
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:11,530
Points, but there would be far more microstates

484
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:15,680
than could possibly be. Computed in the in the age

485
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:20,950
of the universe. So what we have to do is. Sample

486
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:24,280
with some sarcastic randomness, the way that was

487
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:27,040
done on the computer project with with the random

488
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:27,610
walks.

489
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:36,660
Use pseudo random numbers to sample a very

490
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,420
vanishingly small subset of the possible

491
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:41,640
microstates with the

492
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:48,550
selection of the microstates. Organized in such a

493
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:51,410
way that the important microstates are captured

494
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:58,680
and. Reliable, robust. Measurements for the

495
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:02,820
expectation value with controlled uncertainties

496
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:03,840
can be obtained.

497
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:07,510
And.

498
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:16,320
See, there are two topics we could go into at this

499
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,730
point, the

500
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:23,940
field approximation or more about numerical

501
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:29,530
simulations. You're welcome to. And whatever we

502
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:33,610
don't do today, we can save for Thursday. We can

503
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:38,780
also do a bit of. Overview of the entire module.

504
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:42,110
If that would be useful,

505
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:45,230
maybe something

506
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:55,490
fun to do in. The. The last bit here. Would be to

507
00:37:56,450 --> 00:38:02,490
just look at the even simpler. Montecarlo

508
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:05,370
calculation that comes up in this week, letter

509
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:07,810
notes. Where?

510
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:20,360
I link to. A little python code now is already

511
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:23,780
open in this window. Just about

512
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:33,220
ten lines of code or so. That. Can be used to.

513
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:40,740
Compute some approximation to PI by. Randomly

514
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:45,270
sampling with an equal probability. All of the

515
00:38:45,930 --> 00:38:49,320
points in this two by two integration domain,

516
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:55,010
counting the fraction that fall within the unit

517
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:55,620
disk.

518
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,570
Where the fraction is just proportional to the

519
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:06,250
areas of the disc.

520
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:14,270
Compared to the area. The square, which is.

521
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:19,870
Tires squared with that are is one.

522
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:33,200
Here it is, divided by two, by two is four. So

523
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:37,920
that. Multiplying that fraction by four gives

524
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:44,730
estimates for pie on line 18 here, that will

525
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:48,990
become more and more accurate as the number of

526
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:57,310
samples increases. So let me see if I can. Try to

527
00:39:57,790 --> 00:39:59,290
run this quickly.

528
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:14,650
In a python read executed Prince Loopt. Um.

529
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:20,460
And already in the first couple of seconds, we

530
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:24,840
have tests of up one hundred, up to a million

531
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:29,970
samples, which is able to compute PI to a few

532
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:36,360
decimal points, three point one four and. Yeah,

533
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:36,970
even on.

534
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:42,660
Even running on my laptop, which is much faster

535
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:47,130
than going over the cloud here, the the billion

536
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:51,620
samples takes about. Ten minutes to run, so it's

537
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:52,670
going to

538
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,590
zoom in on the results there.

539
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:07,280
Not going to finish properly running. On the cloud

540
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:12,650
like this, I should say that the updated version

541
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:18,110
of the the Python code that is in the repository

542
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:19,250
leaked from the notes.

543
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:26,170
Does a bit of a trick breaking up these in

544
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:32,830
different samples into someone to get back to the

545
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:34,480
current version rather than.

546
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:44,980
That older. Copy break up that these a number of

547
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:51,300
samples into 20 different sets and use the the

548
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:52,570
standard deviation.

549
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:59,710
Of estimates from each of those 20 cents to.

550
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:04,250
Determine the statistical uncertainty that is

551
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:09,980
coming from this finite number of samples. So if I

552
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:14,240
copy this slightly larger and more elaborate code

553
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,840
that's now 20 lines rather than 10.

554
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:22,890
And zoom back out.

555
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:29,980
Paste that in there and see.

556
00:42:33,310 --> 00:42:37,800
That we need. Another library imported.

557
00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:55,320
There's a warning there that would come up on my

558
00:42:56,610 --> 00:42:57,750
laptop, but

559
00:43:00,270 --> 00:43:01,740
see that in addition to.

560
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:05,400
The same estimates that we were getting, three

561
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:10,750
point one for a change, we have some. Estimate for

562
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:13,450
the uncertainty coming from the finite number of

563
00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:18,430
samples, which leaves all of these results

564
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:21,790
consistent with the answer that we know three

565
00:43:21,790 --> 00:43:23,650
point one four one five nine two six five, four

566
00:43:23,650 --> 00:43:24,240
and so on,

567
00:43:26,350 --> 00:43:29,860
but gradually shrinks as the number of samples

568
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:35,080
increases. And in particular, we can confirm here

569
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,430
the square root.

570
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:43,000
Conversions that I believe is is mentioned in the

571
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:43,750
lecture notes.

572
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:48,540
Where I believe that just as an empirical

573
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:51,390
observation at this level, I can see that going

574
00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:51,900
from.

575
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:59,050
Say the thousand samples or the uncertainty was

576
00:43:59,050 --> 00:44:03,370
point to you, three up to 100000 samples, the

577
00:44:03,370 --> 00:44:05,440
uncertainty, so the total number of samples

578
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,690
increased by a factor of one hundred. The

579
00:44:07,690 --> 00:44:10,660
uncertainty decreased by a factor of the square

580
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:13,900
root of 100, which is ten. It is now point zero to

581
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:18,160
six at another factor of one hundred more samples,

582
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:21,160
up to ten million lives. Another factor of ten

583
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:25,510
reduction in the uncertainty to zero zero to four.

584
00:44:26,810 --> 00:44:32,520
And. I guess on the one hand, that is nice, that

585
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:35,670
it's systematically improvable and controllable

586
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:40,980
uncertainties appearing in these. Monte Carlo

587
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:41,940
Calculation's.

588
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:49,280
On the other hand, it's. Now, the square root

589
00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:51,950
convergence is relatively slow, and it means that

590
00:44:51,950 --> 00:44:57,590
for every. Extra decimal place in PI that we want

591
00:44:57,590 --> 00:45:00,260
to determine in this way, we would have to

592
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,560
increase the the scale of the calculation by

593
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:07,940
another factor of a hundred and so on. The cloud

594
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:11,870
here, it's already taking two minutes just to do

595
00:45:13,070 --> 00:45:18,440
one hundred million samples, giving now three

596
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:20,540
significant figures after the decimal point three

597
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:27,360
point one four one. And. I guess that makes it

598
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:30,780
clear is the illustration, this is not the way

599
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:34,140
that you actually compute pi to to many decimal

600
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:37,200
places. So.

601
00:45:39,550 --> 00:45:43,030
And takes us pretty much to the end, it's the last

602
00:45:43,030 --> 00:45:48,790
call for any questions coming in through Zoome or.

603
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:56,570
For people everywhere and we have been. The easy

604
00:45:56,570 --> 00:46:00,680
model phase transition to look into in more detail

605
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:05,690
on Thursday, along with any final module review

606
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:10,790
that may be requested. I will just wrap up with

607
00:46:10,790 --> 00:46:11,650
that today.

608
00:46:17,510 --> 00:46:19,540
In one question did come through before I stopped

609
00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:25,670
recording the structure of the exam, so it's the.

610
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:33,150
Should be. The same sort of structure that came up

611
00:46:33,150 --> 00:46:38,610
in the first term exams in January, I do believe

612
00:46:38,610 --> 00:46:42,300
it's a one hour time on task, there will be

613
00:46:43,590 --> 00:46:46,890
several problems for you to complete. I think it's

614
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:49,440
not giving anything away to say that it will be

615
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,800
one of those exams where all of the the problems

616
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:53,790
are to be attempted

617
00:46:55,870 --> 00:46:58,950
and they will all count toward the the ultimate

618
00:46:58,950 --> 00:47:03,420
mark. So when our time on task with another hour

619
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:07,140
after that, to make sure that any issues coming

620
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:12,330
from uploading or submitting the exam can be dealt

621
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:18,590
with and. A great deal more information about

622
00:47:18,830 --> 00:47:22,430
those sorts of logistics in these instructions, so

623
00:47:22,850 --> 00:47:26,840
if that was not the information that you wanted me

624
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:31,860
to. To comment on let me know.

625
00:47:34,350 --> 00:47:35,580
Otherwise, I will.

626
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:40,140
Wrap up the recording for today.
