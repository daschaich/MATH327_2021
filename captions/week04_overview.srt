00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:04,880
Hello and welcome back to a statistical physics.

2
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:09,400
This is the overview video for a week for an ideal

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:14,060
Agassiz. And before diving into that, let me try

4
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:18,770
something different in case my face might be less

5
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:23,480
interesting than seeing how this overview matches

6
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,080
up with the written material. Now that I have

7
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:33,100
changed the. Software being used to record this

8
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,610
video, I should be able to share my screen and

9
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:40,920
pull up. That's written material on the lecture

10
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:46,650
transcript and won't go through the. The full

11
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:49,890
transcript here, but just be able to point out

12
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,390
where the.

13
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:56,920
Comments I'm making correspond to the text that

14
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:01,630
you have available to read at your leisure. So as

15
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:07,090
I said, week for high gases is coming after a few

16
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:10,060
weeks of Quick Hits, looking at slightly different

17
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:14,020
topics, first probability foundations than the

18
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:16,600
formulation of the micro canonical statistical

19
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,510
ensemble and then the formulation of the canonical

20
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:23,960
ensemble. And now week four, we're. Dive again a

21
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,980
bit more deeply to the first really large scale

22
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:31,370
application of these canonical ensembles to

23
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,390
physical systems that historically have been very

24
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:37,580
important to the development of statistical

25
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:40,250
physics and remain a very.

26
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:45,020
Good starting point, a good approximation for a

27
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:48,140
large number of applications. So these are ideal

28
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:54,470
gases and specifically a simplified ideal gases

29
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:59,390
that neglect the effects of quantum physics. The

30
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:02,150
terminology for that is they are classical. They

31
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:05,030
neglect the effects of special relativity. They

32
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:08,660
are non relativistic, and they neglect the effects

33
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:14,210
of interaction between the particles out of which

34
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:15,260
this gas is made.

35
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:22,960
And that is the terminology for ideal gases and

36
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:25,660
really when we say we're neglecting those

37
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:29,260
interactions, you mean that they don't impact the

38
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:32,710
energy of the particular micro state, which is

39
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:35,200
then just given by the direct some over the

40
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:40,480
energies of all of the individual particles? And

41
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,610
there is a. Bit of a song and dance, so we have to

42
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:46,820
go through even to take those energies and define

43
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:49,550
the partition function with them because the

44
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:53,300
partition function is a sum over microstates, we

45
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:56,780
need to make sure that this sum is well defined in

46
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:00,380
the sense of the microstates are accountable. We

47
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,720
do that with an onsides which turns out to be.

48
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:07,670
Justified by quantum physics as quantum physics is

49
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:12,080
not a prerequisite for this module, it is just

50
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,180
Trainspotting exercise for those of you who have

51
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:17,570
previously taken it to recognize the particle in a

52
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:23,810
box calculation. Which gives us a well-defined.

53
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,950
Canonical partition function, so we fix the number

54
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:31,610
of particles, we fix the temperature by having our

55
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:35,420
ideal gas in contact, thermal contact with a large

56
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:38,840
thermal reservoir, and then we are able to come up

57
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,590
actually with two distinct partition functions,

58
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:46,340
both of which are built on this single particle

59
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,470
case. And they differ by.

60
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:53,680
Assuming whether or not the particles are

61
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,920
distinguishable or indistinguishable in the

62
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,620
disclosable case, the partition function is just

63
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:04,060
in factors of the single particle partition

64
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:07,540
function, whereas in the indistinguishable case,

65
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:12,250
there is a overcounting factor that comes in,

66
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:17,170
turns out to be a factor in factorial. Assuming

67
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:24,070
that all of the particles in this gas have. Unique

68
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:27,190
momento, which is an assumption and a footnote

69
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:31,300
here that we will get back to when we look at

70
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:35,800
quantum statistics after the term break. So given

71
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,650
the partition function for both those

72
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:41,710
distinguishable and indistinguishable cases, all

73
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:44,680
of the derived quantities that were interested in

74
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,040
predicting from the underlying properties of this

75
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:52,000
gas come straight out of that partition function.

76
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:57,460
And most elegantly, in the form of the Helmholtz

77
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:00,700
free energy, which is directly related to the

78
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,340
logic of that partition function, we get the

79
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:07,120
average internal energy which depends quite

80
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,690
directly on the conserve quantities or the fixed

81
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:12,700
quantities of the canonical ensemble, the

82
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:16,120
temperature and the number of particles, as well

83
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:22,710
as the entropy. Which turns out to depend on

84
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:25,440
whether or not the particles are distinguishable

85
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,770
in a way that the energy, the average internal

86
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:32,180
energy does not. And this has

87
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:37,160
make some sense if we think of the entropy is

88
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,910
measuring the logarithm of the number of

89
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:44,600
microstates with the given energy, that depends on

90
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,870
how well we can distinguish the different

91
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:50,360
particles that form those microstates from each

92
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:54,950
other. And another aspect of distinguished ability

93
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:58,370
and the physical effects of pure information

94
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:03,560
content of the system comes from what is known as

95
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:07,610
the mixing entropy, where the basic idea to

96
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:14,150
overview is shown in this diagram that I will try

97
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:20,660
to fit onto my screen as best I can. We're

98
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:26,420
similarly to the consideration of heat exchange in

99
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:29,900
the micro economical context back in week two here,

100
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:33,710
we consider particle exchange in the canonical

101
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:37,130
context. So we take two canonical ensembles with

102
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:40,550
the same fixed number of particles, fixed volume

103
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:45,110
and fixed temperature. Remove this barrier between

104
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:47,330
them, let them exchange particles and then

105
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:52,570
reinsert that barrier. And ask, how does the

106
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:56,140
entropy change as we go through this process from

107
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:59,820
one step to the next? The answer turns out to

108
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:03,540
depend on whether or not the particles are

109
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:07,020
distinguishable in particular, so in the

110
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:10,200
indistinguishably case, there is essentially no

111
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:15,130
difference whether the. Barrier is there or not,

112
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:21,910
we can make the approximation that. Reinserting

113
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:24,760
the barrier leaves us with a similar number of

114
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:28,900
particles on each side. This was a trick that was

115
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:32,080
proposed way back in the 70s. And it's sort of

116
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,960
like the situation. If you're open and close the

117
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,290
door, a door between two identical rooms, nothing

118
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:40,690
very dramatic happens in that process is

119
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:45,850
reversible without changing the entropy of the

120
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:50,020
universe. In the distinguishable case, instead of

121
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,300
opening and closing a door between two identical

122
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:56,620
rooms where doing something more like pouring milk

123
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:00,640
into tea, that once the particles from the two

124
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,550
systems mix, there's sort of no way to reverse

125
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:07,450
that mixing and disentangle them. And that

126
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:13,270
manifests itself in the form of what is known as a

127
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:19,150
mixing entropy, where after removing the barrier,

128
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,920
the total entropy of the system increases by this

129
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:28,480
non-zero amount. That fact increases linearly with

130
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,390
the number of particles in the system.

131
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:40,250
The last topic, which is a bit of a transition

132
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:45,010
from the. Basic framework of ideal gas is in the

133
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:49,210
canonical ensemble to the following week dynamical

134
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:54,640
cycles looks at the pressure, the ideal gas law

135
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,830
and equations of state law generally. Based on the

136
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:03,840
observation from some of the. Fundamental

137
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,630
definitions, the petition function and Helmholtz

138
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:11,460
free energy depend not just on the number of

139
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:16,740
particles or the fixed temperature, but also on

140
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:22,980
the volume into which we place this ideal gas. And

141
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,620
this identifies that volume as what is known as a

142
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:28,620
control parameter, something that we can imagine

143
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:33,010
controlling in an experimental setup. And

144
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:36,940
interesting things happen when we consider the

145
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:40,390
response of the system to variations in this

146
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:44,440
control parameter subject to certain conditions,

147
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:49,630
as usual, the condition we look at here is keeping

148
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:54,520
the entropy constant, which defines what are known

149
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:57,910
as adiabatic processes. These are important enough

150
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:02,990
to merit. Their own fancy terminology, and in

151
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:06,980
particular, the idiomatic change in the internal

152
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:10,370
energy of a system upon changing its volume

153
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:15,960
defines the pressure. Which then, as we go through

154
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:20,160
that confrontation, shows up in the form of an

155
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:26,700
ideal gas law relating. The. Large scale.

156
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,740
Properties of the system, its pressure volume,

157
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,620
number of particles and temperature in the

158
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:37,920
relation that is known for somewhat historical

159
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,120
reasons as an equation of states where the state

160
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,990
being discussed is not the microstates that have

161
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:49,710
played a prominent role in the formulation of the

162
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:53,370
micro and canonical ensembles, but rather the

163
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:56,610
thermodynamic state or macro state of the system

164
00:10:56,610 --> 00:11:00,590
as a whole characterized by these properties and

165
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:05,170
the internal energy. And it is the.

166
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:13,010
Historical development of these concepts of states,

167
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:16,250
macro states and equations of states that connect

168
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:24,370
to the. Thermodynamic cycles and the. Application

169
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:29,080
now of the ideal gas law as a further construction

170
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:31,690
built on top of the framework of the canonical

171
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:34,750
ensemble that is coming up in the following week.

172
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:41,100
But before that, I will let you read the. Written

173
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,610
material in detail and come back with the

174
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:47,730
subsequent wrap up going into a bit more detail

175
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:50,970
about the key points to take away from this.
