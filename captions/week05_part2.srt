1
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:07,590
OK, welcome back to the second part of this.

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:12,810
Summary of the full week, five asynchronous

3
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:16,550
material on through a dynamic cycles. Where we'll

4
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:20,540
just pick up with going through both the context

5
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:24,680
overview and some of the key learning outcomes to

6
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:30,050
take away, starting from the third section of the

7
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:33,260
week's material, which builds on the earlier

8
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:37,730
definitions of work and heat in the statistical

9
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:41,390
physics context to produce bona fides over the

10
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:44,600
dynamic cycles where, again, just to complete that

11
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,420
orientation, we are applying the canonical

12
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:52,580
ensemble to ideal gases in containers with a

13
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:55,940
particular volume. So the volume, particle number

14
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:59,090
and temperature are all controlled parameters of

15
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:03,680
these systems. So we saw in the previous parts of

16
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:09,050
the material that. Work is the change in the

17
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:12,200
internal energy of our ideal gas when its volume

18
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,530
is allowed to change with the entropy being kept

19
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:19,610
fixed and on the other hand, heat is the

20
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:22,940
corresponding change of the internal energy when

21
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:25,220
the entropy is allowed to change with the volume

22
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:29,420
gets fixed. And now we can generalize to the

23
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,940
situation where everything is allowed to change

24
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:35,900
both the entropy and the volume. And I'm

25
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:40,940
expressing that internal energy in terms of the

26
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:43,460
entropy and volume, inverting the usual relation

27
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:46,850
between entropy, temperature and volume. We can

28
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:51,530
quickly write down a leading order multivariable

29
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:54,800
Taylor expansion, which becomes exact in the limit

30
00:01:54,800 --> 00:02:00,070
of infinitesimal changes. And provides. This

31
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:04,810
important equation, sixty seven, which is the

32
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:09,070
generalization of the first law of thermodynamics,

33
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:12,730
two systems described by the canonical ensemble

34
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:15,490
that are able to exchange energy with their

35
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:20,080
surroundings. So while the overall energy of the

36
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,650
universe is conserved, the energy of the system is

37
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:26,740
able to fluctuate by that energy exchange. It can

38
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:32,860
fluctuate in two ways by the exchange of heat or

39
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:36,370
by doing work, either having work done on the

40
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:38,950
system, by its surroundings or the system itself

41
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,080
doing work on its surroundings

42
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,600
and that change in the energy. Now, in the micro

43
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,210
canonical case, that was zero. In the canonical

44
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:55,150
case, it has to match the heat, plus the work that

45
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,380
moves energy between the system and its

46
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:04,360
surroundings. And all together from this week and

47
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,900
last week, we have these four key equations that

48
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:13,630
allow us to consider a variety of manipulations we

49
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:17,950
can do to a system of ideal gases by varying the

50
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:22,060
control parameters, in particular the temperature

51
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:27,010
and volume. We have relations between the internal

52
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:30,690
energy and the temperature. The condition for

53
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:33,330
adiabatic processes or the entropy is constant,

54
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:36,510
that relates the volume to the temperature, you

55
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:38,700
have the ideal gas law from last week and now the

56
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,940
first law of thermodynamics connecting the change

57
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:49,610
in internal energy to heat and work. So. We can

58
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:53,680
imagine doing many. Different things to the system,

59
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:56,030
we can compress it, we can expand it, we can do so

60
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,910
isothermal idiomatically, we can heat it up

61
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,890
because of volume or heat it up the constant

62
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:05,480
pressure. And if we do a lot of those changes, we

63
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:09,350
can imagine trying to end up after a sequence of

64
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:12,680
changing the system, ending up back at the

65
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:17,090
original starting macro states defined by the

66
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,400
pressure, volume, temperature, internal energy and

67
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,440
entropy. And that

68
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,030
generic situation where some sequence of changes

69
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:30,830
leaves the system back. Where it starts is what is

70
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:34,520
our definition of the thermodynamic cycle. It is a

71
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,910
cycle because by ending up where it started, that

72
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,790
process can simply be repeated over and over and

73
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:41,480
over again.

74
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:51,460
Motivating the. Calling it a cycle, that is what a

75
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:55,180
cycle does, something same process repeated over

76
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,850
and over and the particular cycles of the

77
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:03,250
interested in are those that either use heat to

78
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:06,910
have the system do work on its surroundings, which

79
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:10,150
is a form of cycle known as an engine. Or

80
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:14,590
alternately, we can use work to have the system

81
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:18,760
move heat around its surroundings, providing

82
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:23,650
refrigerators in an easy or a convenient visual

83
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:27,730
way of keeping track of these changes. And the

84
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:32,380
cycles they produce is by plotting them as shown

85
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:37,720
here in on the axes of the pressure and the volume

86
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:43,730
of the gas. By the ideal gas law, the pressure and

87
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:46,070
volume, assuming a fixed number of particles,

88
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:48,380
which we always do with a with the canonical

89
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:51,290
ensemble, the pressure, volume and particle number

90
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:53,690
to find the temperature, the temperature then

91
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:57,380
gives the internal energy. And the interview

92
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:02,960
itself is also derived from all of these

93
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:06,740
controlled parameters, so the plot here is

94
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:10,100
illustrating the isothermal expansion of, I guess,

95
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:16,520
where the. Pressure changes as the volume

96
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:20,990
increases, I've already put in some knowledge that

97
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:23,660
the pressure decreases as the volume increases.

98
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:27,010
And that's something that you can work out, and

99
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:31,000
the line that is produced by changing the volume

100
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,510
at a constant temperature is known as Nisso Thurm

101
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:39,850
representing that isothermal process. Similarly,

102
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:45,970
if we change the volume with no change in entropy.

103
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:51,560
We. Do you expect to see a change in temperature

104
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:57,240
and it's another? Application of the ideal gas law

105
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,140
and an entropy condition to figure out how the

106
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,620
pressure changes as we change the volume

107
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:08,070
idiomatically, which produces on these pressure

108
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:11,970
volume diagrams or PV diagrams, this red curve

109
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:13,440
known as an idea that.

110
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:24,320
And to illustrate. Those ideas and how isothermal

111
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:28,430
native ads and other forms of lines in TV diagrams

112
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:31,700
can be put together to produce thermodynamic

113
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:35,720
cycles, you go through in some detail. One of the

114
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,360
most famous thermodynamic cycles there is the

115
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,320
Karno cycle proposed by Saudi Karno in the 20s.

116
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:49,340
Which is this sequence of isothermal expansion,

117
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:52,370
followed by adiabatic expansion, followed by

118
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:54,980
isothermal compression and finally adiabatic

119
00:07:55,250 --> 00:08:01,340
compression. That in principle should allow us to

120
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:04,970
get back to that starting point, it's not obvious

121
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:07,730
from looking at the cycle that this will be

122
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:11,630
possible and that's a calculation we need to go

123
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:12,080
through.

124
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:18,690
And. While doing that, it can be useful to keep in

125
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:23,270
mind this more physical picture. Of those four

126
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:26,300
processes, isothermal expansion that happened

127
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:29,630
slowly, it allows heat to come into the system,

128
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,210
followed by adiabatic expansion that happens

129
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:34,820
quickly with no heat exchange, followed by

130
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,190
isothermal compression that happens slowly,

131
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:39,830
allowing heat to go out of the system. And finally,

132
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:44,440
adiabatic compression with no heat exchange. And

133
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:48,610
one key aspect of the cycle that is generic to

134
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:51,990
these sorts of thermodynamic cycles for engines

135
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:55,300
and refrigerators is that we're picturing the

136
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:59,320
system of an ideal gas in a volume in contact with

137
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,680
two distinct thermal reservoirs with different

138
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:07,540
temperatures, one with one hot reservoir with the

139
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:12,190
temperature T h and one cold reservoir with a low

140
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:17,100
temperature T.L.. And we don't call T. C, so it's

141
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,430
not confused with that particular point, see in

142
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:21,860
the AP diagram.

143
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:27,720
So in order to establish that this is a

144
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:30,270
self-consistent cycle, there's a bit of.

145
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,840
Checking that has to be done to make sure that if

146
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:41,870
we imagine. Setting up the the system and

147
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:43,610
expanding it first isothermal and then

148
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:46,130
idiomatically we have to show that it is

149
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:50,480
impossible to compress the system in such a way to

150
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,330
get back to the starting points. In other words,

151
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:58,340
we have to show that the. Parameters that are not

152
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:03,020
fixed by that proposed set up can all be

153
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:07,280
consistent with the given input data that are

154
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:12,380
colored red in this plot. So we have to show that

155
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:16,700
all the pressures at point speak and in the

156
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:20,660
unknown volume at D can be chosen in such a way

157
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:24,230
that the cycle closes, which it does turn out to

158
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:24,590
do.

159
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:30,720
Now, given a three week cycle, we can ask, what

160
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,110
does this cycle do in the case of the Karno cycle,

161
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:38,520
as we presented above, it uses the flow of heat

162
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:42,180
from the hot reservoir, the cold reservoir, to do

163
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:48,440
work on the surroundings. And we can illustrate

164
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:52,520
this by considering the efficiency with which this

165
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:56,050
work is done, the efficiency being defined as the

166
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,480
the benefit that we get out the network that is

167
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:03,800
done by the system and surroundings, not counting

168
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,620
the work that the surroundings have to do on the

169
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:10,550
system in order to get the cycle to close. And

170
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:16,610
that is then normalized by the cost that has to be

171
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:20,000
put in to the cycle in order to get this benefits

172
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,600
of the work out. And that cost is just the amount

173
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,270
of input work that has to be fed in from the

174
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:29,420
reservoir, ignoring any and all waste heat that

175
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,790
gets expelled to the cold reservoir in the course

176
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:33,710
of each repetition of the cycle

177
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,210
and computing the well.

178
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:46,750
We can check that this efficiency is a

179
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:51,420
well-defined ratio for an engine, it is always

180
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:55,800
positive. We do we assume we do more work than is

181
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,970
required to run the cycle. And by the first law of

182
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:04,830
thermodynamics, the efficiency can be no no larger

183
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:08,220
than one. And so this eight of the efficiency is

184
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:11,640
always between zero and one. So we can interpret

185
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,640
it as the fraction of the input heat that the

186
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,580
engine is able to use to do work on its

187
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,360
surroundings.

188
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:25,100
If we look at the Curnoe cycle specifically. The

189
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:29,120
computation of the efficiency breaks up into a

190
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:34,100
sequence of much smaller little steps, figuring

191
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:38,280
out the heat that is done by or to the system at

192
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:44,270
each of the four stages of the cycle and. It is

193
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:46,010
convenient when doing that to.

194
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:52,050
You subscripts to keep track of whether the heat

195
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:54,450
is flowing into or out of the system or the work

196
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:57,300
is being done on the system by its surroundings,

197
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,580
were being done by the system on its surroundings,

198
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:02,610
rather than trying to keep track of all the

199
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:08,930
negative signs. That correspond to heat and work

200
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:12,090
flowing in and out in the definitions earlier on.

201
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:13,700
So all of these.

202
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,230
Input and output, heat and work are defined to be

203
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:22,380
positive quantities and going around each of the

204
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:26,730
four cycles and computing them in some cases we

205
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:29,130
know right off the bat the first antibiotic cycle.

206
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:34,200
There's no heat flow. We can quickly combine all

207
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,710
of those small results and find a famous result

208
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:41,190
for the efficiency of the Kado cycle, that is one

209
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:46,230
minus the ratio of the. Of the temperatures, of

210
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:51,760
the cold versus hot reservoirs. So since the cold

211
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:55,140
reservoir is colder than the hot reservoir, we

212
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:58,610
confirm that the efficiency is always positive.

213
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:04,620
And as the hot reservoir becomes infinitely hotter

214
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:07,620
than the cold reservoir, this ratio vanishes and

215
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,950
the efficiency approaches one the theoretical

216
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:14,550
maximum allowed by the first law of thermodynamics.

217
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,140
In fact, the.

218
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,700
The results here for the efficiency of the cardio

219
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,400
cycle efficiency of one minus the temperature

220
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:29,390
ratio turns out to be the maximum possible

221
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:32,450
efficiency that any fellin anemic engine can

222
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:36,110
attain. And that is a consequence of the second

223
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:39,530
law of thermodynamics, which relates those

224
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:45,510
temperatures to the. Or at least the efficient,

225
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:51,330
the efficiency and the flow of heat to the entropy

226
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,950
that comes into the system from the hot reservoir

227
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:59,310
is expelled by the system into the cold reservoir.

228
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:04,640
So after each repetition of the cycle, entropy has

229
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:07,940
moved from the hot reservoir into the system and

230
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,310
then been expelled to the cold reservoir and the

231
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:13,010
second law of thermodynamics says that in that

232
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:17,060
process, the entropy cannot decrease. It may be

233
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:21,920
constant, but generically increases, which means

234
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:26,870
that the efficiency can be at most one minus the

235
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:30,050
temperature ratio and is generally less than that

236
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:34,010
for any thermodynamic engine. So you can freeze

237
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:37,190
this to say that the first law of thermodynamics

238
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:42,500
by imposing the maximum of Ayda equals one means

239
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:46,190
that a a thermodynamic engine can never win. It

240
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:49,940
can never get out more work than energy was put in

241
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:52,340
in the form of heat. While the second law is

242
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:56,090
saying that you can't even break even for any

243
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:58,970
finite temperatures of the hot and cold reservoir,

244
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:03,230
the maximum possible efficiency is always strictly

245
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:09,080
less than one. Some amount of energy is lost to

246
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:12,710
the production of entropy, and the amount of work

247
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:15,770
that can be done is always less than the amount of

248
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:21,170
heat that is put in to the system. And if we were

249
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:25,100
to run the kind of cycle in reverse, we would have

250
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:28,670
hopping back up to the diagram here.

251
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:34,970
We would have heat coming into the system during

252
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:38,750
the isothermal expansion connected to the low

253
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:41,570
temperature reservoir. And then we would expel

254
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:43,700
heat into the high-temperature reservoir by

255
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:44,360
compressing.

256
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:52,750
The system in connection to the hot reservoir and

257
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:55,420
work would be required to do that, moving heat

258
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:58,870
from someplace cold to someplace hot and operating

259
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:05,040
as a refrigerator. Again, the cycle is the. Most

260
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:10,020
efficient refrigerator when run in reverse and.

261
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,040
Despite that efficiency, it is not a really not

262
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:20,730
really a practical system, not a usable.

263
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:28,830
Cycle to apply to. Actual real world devices that

264
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:33,240
either do work or or cool reservoirs, and that is

265
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:37,790
because the isothermal stages. Just operates so

266
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:42,140
slowly that running the Karno cycle would take too

267
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:46,550
long to get any useful work out of it is the

268
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:48,860
engine or get any useful cooling out of it as a

269
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:52,190
refrigerator. And real devices have to sacrifice

270
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:55,820
some of that theoretical efficiency for practical

271
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:59,870
functionality. So that's the note on which will

272
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:04,520
end the consideration of ideal gases,

273
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,830
thermodynamic cycles and the canonical ensemble

274
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:10,910
moving on next week to the final statistical

275
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:13,880
ensemble for the module, the grand canonical

276
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:17,150
ensemble, where both of the internal energy and

277
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:20,030
the particle no will be allowed to change. And

278
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:22,760
we'll get into that here. We'll come back with the

279
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,100
green canonical ensemble next week.
