00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:06,280
OK, welcome back to the second part of this

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:09,370
summary of the week six material on the Koran

3
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:15,100
canonical ensemble. So picking up where we left

4
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,890
off with the previous parts, we saw by going

5
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:21,850
through the the replica trick, just as we did for

6
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:25,450
the canonical ensemble, that's the great canonical

7
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:28,720
ensemble can be formulated entirely in terms of

8
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:34,360
its fixed temperature and chemical potential, with

9
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:39,490
no reference to any nonsense for the large

10
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:42,130
external particle reservoir that fixes the

11
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:44,620
temperature and chemical potential and with which

12
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:47,770
the system of interest is allowed to exchange

13
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:53,980
energy and particles. And based on the temperature

14
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:57,220
and chemical potential, we have the partition, the

15
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:01,570
grand canonical partition function Z Somji, which

16
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:05,410
is the sum over all microstates of our system of

17
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:08,500
this extended bozsum factor that depends on both

18
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,140
the energy and the particle number, both of which

19
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:15,250
can now fluctuate through exchange with that large

20
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:19,150
external particle reservoir. And essentially at

21
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:21,880
this point we are done the grand canonical

22
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:27,600
partition function. Fully specifiers the. The

23
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,350
information present in our statistical ensemble or

24
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:34,320
probability space for this system that is allowed

25
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,410
to evolve in time with fluctuating energy and

26
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:40,440
particle number and the remainder, the last few

27
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,740
pages of the written material for this week are

28
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:48,300
just going through and completing the mathematical

29
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:52,080
calculations to extract those derived quantities

30
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,560
of interest from their basis in the grand

31
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,500
canonical partition function. And again,

32
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,560
continuing the analogy with our development of the

33
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,970
canonical ensemble a few weeks ago, we expect the

34
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:08,820
logarithm of the green canonical partition

35
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:13,200
function to play a particularly prominent role in

36
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,280
these relations. So just to remind you, now that

37
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,200
the energy and particle number are both

38
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,350
fluctuating, the specific energy or particle

39
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,900
number of that particular microstates is no longer

40
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,570
really a meaningful observable. It's not a

41
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:30,660
property of the thermodynamic macro state that we

42
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:33,150
have now become familiar with by working with

43
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:36,960
ideal gases and through the mix cycles. What is a

44
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:42,240
property of that micro state is the macro state is

45
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,560
the average internal energy and particle number.

46
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,940
The expectation value, which from the definition

47
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,850
of expectation value, is obtained from the average

48
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:56,250
over all micro states. So

49
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:04,080
microstates are the individual pieces with their

50
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:06,960
corresponding probabilities, something over all of

51
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,590
which gives us information about the large scale

52
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:14,910
thermodynamic macro state that emerges from the

53
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:19,200
dynamics, the properties of the degrees of freedom

54
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:21,270
of which it consists through.

55
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:26,150
Through the machinery of statistical physics.

56
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:32,790
In anticipating that both of the internal energy

57
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:36,480
particle number and entropy will depend on the

58
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,690
logarithm of that grand canonical potential, we

59
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:43,140
define an analogue of the Helmholtz free energy,

60
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:47,520
which is this capital five that now depends on

61
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,700
both of these fixed quantities, the temperature

62
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:54,600
and chemical potential, which just as the

63
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,580
Helmholtz free energy was the negative temperature

64
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:00,090
at times logarithm of the canonical partition

65
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:03,180
function. The grand canonical potential is the

66
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,420
negative temperature at times the logarithm of the

67
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:10,740
grand canonical partition function. Which allows

68
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:13,680
us to invert this equation, right, the great

69
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,620
canonical partition function in terms of its grand

70
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,330
canonical potential and insert that into the

71
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:25,110
Boston factor, the Walsman distribution for the

72
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:29,240
probability of each micro state. And just to

73
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,180
highlight the similarity with the help, those free

74
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:35,030
energy, this grand economic potential is sometimes

75
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:38,510
called the land of free energy after the Russian

76
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:46,190
physicist Lev Landau. And at this point. There are

77
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:48,860
a few derivatives to grind through, some of which

78
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:52,880
are straightforward, some of which are messier and

79
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,540
can benefit from some preparatory work. And at the

80
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:01,640
end of those calculations, we obtain a relation

81
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:05,660
between these derivatives of the grand canonical

82
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:09,170
potential that potential itself or equivalently,

83
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:11,270
the logarithm of the grand canonical partition

84
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:15,400
function. Along with the internal energy and the

85
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,900
average particle, No. All with three factors,

86
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:24,000
giving them the the same dimensions, the same

87
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,620
units, and by considering the entropy and plugging

88
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:34,550
in. The result that we found from. For

89
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,390
maximisation, Villefranche multipliers for the

90
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,940
micro say probability carrying out that

91
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:47,000
calculation gives us relations among these three

92
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,480
derived quantities and the grand economic

93
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:57,450
potential. That look. Quite similar to what we had

94
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:02,070
for the energy and entropy in terms of derivatives

95
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:06,660
of the Helmholtz free energy, when the particle

96
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,690
number was fixed and the chemical potential was

97
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:15,240
not in the game, these derivatives of the free

98
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,660
energy with respect to temperature and derivatives

99
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,820
of the ratio of the free energy divided by

100
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,740
temperature of the log of the partition function

101
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:26,670
also showed up in that case in the canonical

102
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:33,810
ensemble. So these are the. Useful relations that

103
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:37,400
we will be. Putting into practice after the break,

104
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:41,930
in applications of the grand canonical ensemble

105
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:47,120
focus on quantum systems, which will need some

106
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,500
additional consideration of what exactly makes a

107
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,820
statistical system, quantum or otherwise. But

108
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:58,160
before we move on to the break and eventually

109
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:03,760
those applications. We can get a little bit more

110
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,760
insight into the chemical potential just by seeing

111
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:10,240
how it appears in these sorts of relations that

112
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:15,320
also involve the energy and entropy. This

113
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:20,570
connection between energy and tea time times, the

114
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:25,430
entropy was also something that we saw in the

115
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:29,120
first law of thermodynamics while considering

116
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:32,930
thermodynamic cycles last week there was this

117
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:36,590
relation that the change in energy in a

118
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:39,320
thermodynamic cycle described by the canonical

119
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:45,770
ensemble was the heat added, plus the work done on

120
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:48,800
that system where heat was temperature. At times

121
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,500
the change in entropy and work was negative.

122
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:55,420
Pressure times the change in volume. And we can

123
00:07:55,420 --> 00:08:02,430
now generalize that, considering the. Particle

124
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:06,210
number two also be allowed to change in our third

125
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:13,840
Adamick system. And express the. Entropy is a

126
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,290
function not just of energy and the volume of the

127
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:20,740
system, but all three parameters, energy, volume

128
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:27,140
and particle number. This here is just the basic

129
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:30,830
calculus relation, connecting the derivative to

130
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:34,490
its partial derivatives with in each case, all but

131
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:37,610
one of those three parameters kept fixed.

132
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:42,720
Two of which we can identify as the inverse

133
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:46,860
temperature and. Negative chemical potential

134
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,440
divided by temperature that we have previously

135
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,740
considered, we're putting everything together and

136
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:57,120
multiplying through by this factor of one over

137
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,230
temperature, rearranging the terms, we generalize

138
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:03,150
the first law of thermodynamics further to the

139
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:07,910
case where the particle number can fluctuate. And

140
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:11,570
now the total change in energy is the heat added

141
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:15,500
that changes the entropy, the mechanical work,

142
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:20,750
that changes the volume with a given pressure and

143
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:23,690
what we might call the chemical work, which

144
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:26,750
changes the particle number at a fixed chemical

145
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:27,350
potential.

146
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:33,320
This equation eighty six is a generalized

147
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:39,860
thermodynamic identity that is quite useful if we

148
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:45,050
want to remember or derive relations between these

149
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:47,390
various quantities energy, entropy, volume and

150
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:52,310
particle number. As an example, if we fix the

151
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:55,160
volume of the particle number, then we immediately

152
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:59,660
get back to the relation that one over temperature

153
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:05,270
is the response of the entropy to the energy which

154
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:10,840
we saw already back in week to. And if we

155
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,210
similarly fix the particle number and the entropy

156
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:15,760
and look at the idiomatic response of the energy

157
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,400
with respect to a change in the volume, that is

158
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:23,290
just the pressure we. Introduced when considering

159
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:27,730
ideal gases. And what is particularly interesting

160
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:30,370
right now, what we're trying to get, trying to

161
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:32,860
build up some intuition for the chemical potential

162
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:37,750
is to fix the entropy sudsing zero, fix the volume

163
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,990
so is zero, and then find that the chemical

164
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:44,920
potential new is the response of the energy to a

165
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:48,070
change in particle. No, where that change is done

166
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,610
in a fixed volume and idiomatically so the

167
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:56,440
chemical potential is essentially how much energy

168
00:10:56,770 --> 00:11:01,330
is added or removed from the system as some

169
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:04,660
particle or degree of freedom is added or removed.

170
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:09,160
And we can also from this relation, confirm our

171
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,710
argument earlier that the chemical potential is

172
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:15,340
generically negative for natural systems because

173
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:18,370
we've argued that adding degrees of freedom to

174
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:22,120
systems tends to increase its entropy. And in

175
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,100
order to keep that entropy fixed, we have to

176
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,370
counteract that increase in the way to do that,

177
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:30,730
the natural system with positive temperature is to

178
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:35,710
decrease the energy. So whenever the particle

179
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:39,550
number increases, the energy has to decrease. So

180
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:42,100
the overall sign of that partial derivative is

181
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,950
negative and vice versa if the particle number

182
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:51,910
decreases at fixed entropy. So that is the

183
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:56,500
completion of the introduction, at least of the

184
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,410
final of the three statistical ensembles that we

185
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:01,900
consider in this module, we now have micro,

186
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:02,590
canonical,

187
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:07,720
canonical and grand canonical ensembles

188
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:12,950
appropriate for different situations where. Our

189
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:15,890
probabilistic system is sampling states through

190
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:19,010
time, evolution subject to different constraints,

191
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,510
fixed energy and particle number for micro

192
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:24,110
economical temperature and particle number four,

193
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,840
canonical and fixed temperature and chemical

194
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,840
potential for grand canonical. And once we get

195
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,480
back from the break, we will.

196
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:38,110
Dive into quantum statistics and use that as the

197
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:41,800
playground to apply the creative canonical

198
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:46,510
ensemble, learn about various sorts of quantum

199
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:49,930
statistical systems, how they behave and connect

200
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:55,950
that to some familiar. Phenomenon like the. The

201
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:59,730
sun shining in the sky for now, though, we have

202
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,480
all the basic material and can take a break to

203
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:05,610
incorporate it and.

204
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:12,600
Gain more comfort in familiarity with these

205
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,500
foundations.
