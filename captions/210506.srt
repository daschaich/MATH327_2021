1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,930
OK, the recording should be under way. Let's get going

2
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:10,340
with the final stretch for statistical physics now

3
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:17,870
that we are in May and diving into the the last

4
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:20,090
significant topic for the module, which is

5
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:24,380
interacting systems, but before I before we get

6
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:29,960
into that, let me pull up the usual

7
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:38,540
invitation for any questions that any of you may

8
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:46,420
have about. The material so far in the. In the

9
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:49,360
module either this week or previous weeks.

10
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:53,560
And.

11
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:57,890
As well, any.

12
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:03,110
Questions about other aspects of the module.

13
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:06,230
There's not too much logistics to deal with

14
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:10,250
anymore. The exam is coming up in about three

15
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:13,520
weeks on catching up with the marking that'll get

16
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,180
back to you

17
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:19,730
all next week, hopefully. Definitely has to be, do,

18
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:22,460
will be or definitely has to be done well before

19
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:27,170
the exam happens. And then it is just.

20
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,140
You know, going through exam preparation with some

21
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:35,230
additional sample questions and solutions being

22
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:38,410
provided in the last couple of weeks worth of

23
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:42,730
material on interacting statistical systems and

24
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,590
their broader applications.

25
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:54,260
And I'm just pausing for a moment to see if there

26
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:58,610
are any questions at the outset, which at any time

27
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:05,800
be free to. And they're hoping that poll or. Just

28
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:10,120
bring up. And zoom out loud or in the chat window.

29
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:19,950
Not seeing any so far, I will. Charge ahead with

30
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:24,870
the. The week 10 material, which is.

31
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,840
Taking what's really a significant step, that kind

32
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,810
of setting up. All of our work for.

33
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:39,170
Broader applications in the ways that this could

34
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:45,200
be built on in many directions where, as I've said

35
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,750
before, during the the bulk of the module, the

36
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:51,380
previous nine weeks, we've been making one

37
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:54,980
particular simplification in all of our work that

38
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:59,630
has been very significant. And that has been the

39
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:02,120
assumption that when we deal with these

40
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,440
statistical systems that consist of a large number

41
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:11,270
of underlying constituents, we have made the

42
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,400
assumption or the approximation that those

43
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:16,760
constituents do not interact with each other in

44
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,490
any significant way. And this is

45
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:25,130
this is the ideal part of the ideal gas that we

46
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:29,030
introduced all the way back in week four and was

47
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:32,540
also the future of, say, spin systems considered

48
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:37,850
even prior to that, where what this has allowed us

49
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:42,500
to do in both the classical and quantum context is

50
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:46,130
basically break up the overall calculation of

51
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:48,920
these 10 to the power of twenty three or however

52
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:54,290
many particles into just a single calculation for

53
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:56,360
a single particle to start interacting with the

54
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,700
others. And then we just essentially raise that to

55
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,450
the ten to the twenty three power. What I just

56
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:05,450
described is classical approach, but we saw that a

57
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:13,010
similar sort of factorization also occurs for the

58
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:16,280
quantum approach of considering energy levels and

59
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,610
occupation numbers rather than individual

60
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:24,620
particles, where in non interacting settings we

61
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:28,880
just end up with either a sum or a product over

62
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:33,110
those possible energy levels, depending on whether

63
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:37,310
we're considering the partition function or its

64
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:38,870
logarithm, the free energy.

65
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,920
And while we were able to do a lot of things with

66
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:48,540
monitoring systems ranging from heat engines to

67
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,410
the spectrum of heat and light from the sun and

68
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:54,480
from the cosmic microwave background, as well as

69
00:04:54,480 --> 00:05:00,740
the Fairbury pressure that keeps. All stars from

70
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:04,830
collapsing in on themselves, there are. At least

71
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:07,110
some things that do require the kinds of

72
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:11,810
interactions that we encounter in. In our everyday

73
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:16,220
life where we don't simply pass through. All of

74
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,920
the materials that are able to touch them and

75
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:23,540
interact with them and the the class of examples

76
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:28,900
that is focused on. In. In this week and in this

77
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:32,110
module, the general is the phenomenon of phase

78
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:36,010
transitions where statistical systems that are

79
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:40,950
built up of exactly the same constituents. Behave

80
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,190
and qualitatively different ways, depending on.

81
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,260
How those constituents are interacting with each

82
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:56,030
other or the control parameters that we can adjust

83
00:05:56,420 --> 00:06:00,380
in these in the system are an experiment to.

84
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:08,160
To verify or to to control the behavior of these

85
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,120
constituents, and the classic example is the

86
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,770
behavior of of water, which can exist in the

87
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:20,820
phases of the gas, a steam, just liquid water and

88
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,050
various sorts of solid ice. There are if you dig

89
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:27,420
into the details, there are many different phases

90
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:32,820
of of water, of H2O molecules that depend on

91
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:36,780
control parameters like the the temperature and

92
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:40,790
the pressure, things that. That can be controlled

93
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:46,470
in experiments or in just everyday settings. But,

94
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:48,870
of course, that that's the familiar example, but

95
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:53,030
these transitions are really. All around it, if

96
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:55,400
you if you start to look for them from the

97
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:00,560
earliest microseconds of the universe where. The

98
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,670
elementary particles that existed in a confined

99
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:08,840
plasma shortly after the Big Bang underwent a

100
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,630
phase transition to form the so-called confined

101
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:15,430
neutrons and protons that we are built out of in

102
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:19,520
the modern day, as well as all sorts of

103
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:24,470
solid-state or magnetic systems where the typical

104
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:29,300
transition is between insulating and conducting

105
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,350
phases that.

106
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:37,490
Determine whether or not the electrons in these

107
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,230
materials are able to.

108
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:44,100
To propagate freely or if they are bound and tied

109
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:49,570
to particular atoms or molecules. The example

110
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:55,540
mentioned in the notes here is that a transition

111
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:58,330
to a superconducting phase where not only can the

112
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:00,610
electrons propagate, they actually propagate

113
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,760
without any resistance or without friction. They

114
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:09,940
don't lose any energy to heat. And this occurs in

115
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,000
many sorts of so-called superconducting materials

116
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,510
at low temperature. The one pictured here is two

117
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:20,890
layers of graphene that are stacked on top of each

118
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:28,660
other and misaligned by a small angle theta where?

119
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,570
Through some sort of remarkable effects, all

120
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:37,900
related to the interactions between the particles

121
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:42,190
in the system, superconductivity only sets in when

122
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:46,000
this angle theta takes a particular magic value.

123
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:51,600
About about one degree. So.

124
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,570
I should say, just as a brief supplement, that

125
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,680
there is.

126
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:04,050
At least one case in which you can't have a phase

127
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:07,800
transition without interactions between the

128
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,640
constituents of a statistical system, and that is

129
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:15,360
in the context of both sides on conversation that

130
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,770
we talked about maybe 10 days ago, wrapping up the

131
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:21,960
week, eight materials where.

132
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:30,550
The the gas of those islands that. Or the ideal

133
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:33,470
gas, I should specify, of not attracting bosun's,

134
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,800
the sort of thing that would be considered in the

135
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,200
special case of fermions necessary in such a case

136
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,600
of photons, zero mass ultra relativistic particles.

137
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,330
That is a particular phase. Of a collection of

138
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:52,030
boatswain's, and as the temperature decreases, we

139
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:54,370
looked at just the video illustration without

140
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:57,640
doing the mathematics, seeing that there is a

141
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:01,180
transition to a new phase of matter, the Bose

142
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:06,500
Einstein condensate. Where? There is still no

143
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,800
interaction between the the individual, those

144
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,520
islands in the SCAS, but due to quantum effects

145
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:17,510
and the competition between those quantum effects

146
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:19,310
and the thermal effects of the temperature, even

147
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:22,280
these not interact, those can undergo a phase

148
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:26,450
transition from that ideal gas to that quantum

149
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:31,850
Bose Einstein condensate phase. But in general, as

150
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:37,340
a rule, these transitions and many other sorts of

151
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:40,580
interesting behavior depend on the interactions

152
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:46,250
between the particles in our our systems and to do

153
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:49,370
things mathematically and concretely. This week we

154
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:55,430
will look at the two state spin systems that we

155
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:59,090
introduced all the way back in week two and three

156
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,850
in the non interacting setting, where in that case

157
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:06,290
the energy was just given by how these individual

158
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:13,640
spins as coupled to an external magnetic field of

159
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:17,720
strength h which I believe should be drawn. On the

160
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:22,070
next page here and in week three, we went through.

161
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:26,630
Some of the different setups that we can have,

162
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:30,110
even in the simple system, whether the spins are

163
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:35,120
fixed into a a solid framework or whether they're

164
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,570
allowed to to move about freely is a gas.

165
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:46,310
And seeing the effect that the corresponding

166
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:50,960
information we had had on the thermodynamics or

167
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,420
the statistical predictions for those two

168
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:57,200
different cases where the spins were able to move

169
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,200
freely as a gas, we could not distinguish between

170
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:06,840
them and had less information. About the the

171
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,330
system and therefore of observe to different

172
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:13,120
behavior in its derived quantities, the entropy,

173
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:17,200
in the internal energy. Or the interacting system

174
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:22,870
will focus just on the case of distinguishable

175
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:26,260
spins that are distinguished by having a fixed

176
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:30,520
position in some regular grid, that.

177
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,850
I'm going to call a Allardice

178
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:45,210
and. Basically, what allowed us is at the broadest

179
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:54,290
level. Is a way of. Positioning or spacing, the.

180
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:58,440
The particles that the degrees of freedom more

181
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:04,170
generally that make up the. The statistical system

182
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:07,550
in question. I'm trying to be as general as

183
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:10,910
possible here without specifying too many things,

184
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:15,140
which we will go on to specialize too. We have

185
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:15,530
some.

186
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:22,590
Regular grid of locations in space where those

187
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:26,190
degrees of freedom are located in that have an

188
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:29,700
effect on how those degrees of freedom interact

189
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:33,870
with each other. So to start now specializing in

190
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:36,600
becoming more specific and more concrete for

191
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:41,160
actual calculations, say that will work only with

192
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:46,410
simple cubic lattices, possibly in an arbitrary

193
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:52,710
number of dimensions where the the system of spins

194
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:57,570
placed in a line. Was precisely the the

195
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:00,810
distinguishable case that we considered all the

196
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:03,600
way back in week three in the not interacting

197
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:09,200
setting to. To look at the entropy and energy and

198
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:13,790
the effects of information on those systems. So

199
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:18,540
what's pictured here is a. You two dimensional

200
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:26,880
lattice with. For spins in one direction, in four

201
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:32,440
spins in another, so overall, a four by four site

202
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:36,840
Latisse or Inequal 16, the individual spins

203
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:41,940
labeled by their location in each of those two

204
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:46,620
dimensions. And take values, depending on their

205
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:51,000
orientation, aligned with or aligned against this

206
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:53,010
extraordinary field H.

207
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:57,500
And.

208
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,010
The place to start to make things concrete and

209
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:06,560
mathematical is to more formally define. What

210
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,150
exactly is meant by.

211
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,900
By an interaction or by a non interacting system.

212
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:18,680
Which we can do by considering what happens to.

213
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:23,810
The internal energy. When we change, when we pick

214
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:28,580
out some degree of freedom and change it. So in a

215
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:31,190
not in tracking system where that degree of

216
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:34,010
freedom is not interacting with any of the other

217
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:36,500
degrees of freedom and should therefore know

218
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:40,610
nothing about them, we would expect the resulting

219
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:42,890
change in the total energy of the system from

220
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:47,510
changing that degree of freedom to label by. I

221
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:51,050
expect that change to be independent of every

222
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:55,460
other degree of freedom labeled by K. That is not

223
00:15:55,880 --> 00:16:02,230
equal to I. And it's easy to see for the the not

224
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:05,670
interacting spin system that we looked at before

225
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:11,260
if we break up. The sum over all of the spins that

226
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:14,500
couples to the external magnetic field to pick out

227
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:18,670
whatever spin, whatever degree of freedom we are

228
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:21,790
changing, there's only one possible change we can

229
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:26,110
make in a two state spin system, which is simply

230
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:29,140
reversing the orientation of that spin with

231
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:32,050
respect to the magnetic field or in other words,

232
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:37,930
changing inside. And when they do that, the sign

233
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:42,170
of that speed changes. All of the other spins are

234
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,900
unaffected, and if we take the difference between

235
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:50,000
the the final energy and the starting energy, we

236
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,240
end up with those summations over all the other

237
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:57,740
spins cancelling out. And all that's left is a

238
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:01,280
simple function that depends. Only on the spin

239
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:04,720
that was changed, so. The

240
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:10,030
formal definition of a not a tracking system

241
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:13,180
checks out in a straightforward way for that case,

242
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:17,320
and now we can change the set up of the spin

243
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:24,720
system by introducing a. A new term in the energy,

244
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,690
so in this equation, when 18, the second term is

245
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:32,530
exactly what we had before back in weeks, two and

246
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:36,850
three each spin coupling to that external magnetic

247
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:39,160
field. And to that we add.

248
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:45,160
This initial term, which has a product of two

249
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:49,150
spins and Jane in a funny label at the bottom of

250
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:55,170
the station sign. This is in parentheses labeling

251
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:58,170
those two spins that appear in this quadratic

252
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:05,540
product. And what this notation means is that. We

253
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,440
are considering.

254
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:14,380
Indices I enjoy that run over all of the the

255
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:16,900
nearest neighbors in the simple cubicle, a

256
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:19,870
structure that we have defined. So if we hop back

257
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:25,840
up to this two dimensional case and consider some

258
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,900
particular spin, say that one that I just circled,

259
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:34,330
its nearest neighbors are in this case, the the

260
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:38,050
four things that are a constant distance away from

261
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:42,280
it, both to the left and right, as well as up and

262
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:47,470
down. In this two dimensional lattice, so the.

263
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:55,660
For this. Particular spin circled in blue, that

264
00:18:55,660 --> 00:19:00,700
first term in the new energy equation 118 is

265
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:08,830
something over the. The four products of. This

266
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:13,090
term with all of its four nearest neighbors and

267
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:15,730
then doing the same for all of the other students

268
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:20,510
in the lattice without any double counting. So if

269
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:24,020
we hop over to consider the Spinto the rights of

270
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:26,420
the one that we circled, we've already accounted

271
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:29,180
for its interaction with its nearest neighbor to

272
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:33,320
the left. So that is that term in this sum is

273
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,130
accounted for

274
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:37,160
and.

275
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:43,320
See, since there is. A smaller crowd, I'll skip

276
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,690
the the polls everywhere and just stop.

277
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:53,930
Go through the the confirmation that this new term

278
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:58,520
in the energy does indeed produce an interacting

279
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,020
system.

280
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:06,250
Just by doing the same sort of procedure is for

281
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:11,290
the non in case in this box.

282
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:19,380
Where we can start by writing down. The energy

283
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:23,520
with the particular lights then pulled out and

284
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,960
isolated, so just changed the notation to some

285
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,780
over the nearest neighbor, here's J and K

286
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:33,240
specifying that those are only the pairs that do

287
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:37,170
not contain that spin, ie that has been changed.

288
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:43,510
Thus the product S.J České. There is an.

289
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,180
The term with the external magnetic field, as

290
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:55,530
usual, Sunday over. All the spins, except. The

291
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:59,130
spin I and then we have the contributions from

292
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:04,530
that spin I, we have the terms over all of its

293
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:06,690
nearest neighbors. So those sites, they were by

294
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:10,520
KABE. We're case in the set of nearest neighbors,

295
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:16,600
I think. So this is all of the terms that were not

296
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,030
included in that first summation.

297
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,920
So all of the nearest neighbor payers have now

298
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,770
been accounted for and all that's left is the

299
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:31,210
coupling of spin eye to that external magnetic

300
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:38,640
field. And when we negate the spin. The first two

301
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:43,530
terms don't involve spin any longer, they are

302
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:44,340
unchanged.

303
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,690
And in the. Last two terms.

304
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:56,760
The sign.

305
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:07,680
Is simply. Loopt. So as K and minus. HCI, so the

306
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,090
difference is.

307
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:20,420
A factor of two. This sum over. All of the nearest

308
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:24,020
neighbors of the site that we have changed.

309
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:29,000
And then the same coupling to the external

310
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,280
magnetic field that we had an unattractive case

311
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:36,830
and because these české are different than they

312
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:38,510
are, the nearest neighbors are the. That was

313
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:44,400
changed as opposed to. Being that that site.

314
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,020
We see that.

315
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:53,330
This indicates we are indeed dealing with an

316
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:57,230
interacting system. Is desire.

317
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:07,150
Maybe a. Simpler way to keep track of things.

318
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:12,810
Equivalent to talking about all of those nearest

319
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:16,020
neighbors and the nearest neighbor, Pear's, is to.

320
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:23,070
Introduce a bit more terminology for these simple

321
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:27,420
Kubic Gladys's in any number of dimensions where

322
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:32,010
we can sort of introduce elementary one and two

323
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:33,870
and three dimensional.

324
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:41,230
Unit objects that the the overall lattice system

325
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:46,030
itself is or can be considered as being built out

326
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:46,270
of.

327
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:58,230
So rather than drawing up and down, pointing

328
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:02,340
arrows to to represent the spin degrees of freedom

329
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:07,710
in these systems. It's conventional just to to

330
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:11,220
denote the locations of those spins by some black

331
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:17,440
dot. Where the figure on the right here, the the

332
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,180
shading of the data is being used to indicate the

333
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:22,900
the third dimension.

334
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,750
The idea that the the lighter the dogs get, the

335
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:32,460
farther into the page, the third dimension has

336
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:37,530
progressed, it's. About as best as you can do,

337
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:41,370
representing three dimensions in. The two

338
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:46,550
dimensional page that we're looking at here. And.

339
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:54,920
In addition to those dots at which the the spins

340
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,410
or the more general degrees of freedom are are

341
00:24:57,610 --> 00:25:01,700
going to want to live in V dimensions, we can

342
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:05,000
connect the nearest neighbors and only the nearest

343
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,480
neighbors by drawing lines between them that

344
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:13,220
become known as or have become known as links. And

345
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:16,340
these are sort of the elementary objects that

346
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:19,910
appear in that first term of the energy we were

347
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:20,600
looking at.

348
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:25,440
This first term of the box here is really a sum

349
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,260
over the links, whereas the second term that we

350
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:32,640
had before is the sum over the individual sites.

351
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:37,530
So the links are essentially representing the

352
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:41,070
interaction between these nearest neighbor pairs.

353
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:47,960
In the interacting system we have set up and, you

354
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:52,080
know, going further three dimensions is sort of

355
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,110
the most that we can have in the world that we

356
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:57,210
live in. But mathematically, we can define

357
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:01,410
lattices in any number of dimensions, because you

358
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:04,320
mentioned that the two dimensional system, we

359
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:08,100
could experimentally realized by doing experiments

360
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:12,710
with a thin film of degrees of freedom. On the top

361
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:15,740
of some table and even reduce that to a one

362
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:21,470
dimensional lattice, a simple chain of spins. But

363
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:23,180
as we go into higher dimensions, there are

364
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:26,540
analogous elementary unit objects known as

365
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:29,870
Phuket's and cubes, one of which is drawn here

366
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:32,930
with the cat being the elementary unit of surface

367
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:35,540
area and the cube being an elementary unit of

368
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:39,170
volume once we hit three dimensions.

369
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:47,090
And one of the wrinkle that. You might have to

370
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:53,240
worry about in these latter systems is what

371
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:56,690
happens if we reach the edge of the lattice and

372
00:26:56,690 --> 00:27:02,470
there's no longer. Any more sites for. For our

373
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:03,490
spins to.

374
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:09,430
To share a link with or to have a have an

375
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:13,790
interaction with. There are various options, one

376
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:16,610
of which is the formal mathematical level, just to

377
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:19,310
consider an infinite lattice that goes off forever

378
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:20,330
in every direction.

379
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:26,080
And we can also just say that the lattice ends, we

380
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:30,280
can chop off any of the links that go out from the

381
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:34,720
edge of that lattice, but the mathematically most

382
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,710
convenient way to handle this sort of thing is to

383
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:42,990
impose. What are called boundary conditions in a

384
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:46,230
particular imposing periodic boundary conditions

385
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:53,730
where we identify the in this case, the leftmost

386
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:57,660
site in the lattice as the the nearest neighbor.

387
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,850
Link of the nearest neighbor site of the rightmost

388
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:06,940
site so that the link connecting them.

389
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:13,570
Is just another standard link, like any other link

390
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:16,900
in the Latisse, so there's a constant distance

391
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:24,150
between. The. The sites here at the. Right, edge

392
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:30,220
of the lattice that. Circles around to talk to the

393
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:33,820
side at the left edge, it's just as far away as it

394
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:39,190
is from the. The other nearest neighbor in the

395
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:42,580
other direction, and at least in one dimension,

396
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:45,700
this is easy to to represents by

397
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:52,180
bending this chain of sites around into a circle

398
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:57,430
where. We can see that or see the reason this

399
00:28:57,670 --> 00:28:59,680
periodic boundary condition set up is convenient,

400
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:03,100
because now every single spin or every single site

401
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:06,560
is on. On the same footing with the same number of

402
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,630
nearest neighbors, you don't have to worry about

403
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:12,500
where exactly it is located in the lattice or to

404
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:18,500
put this in a more mathematical freezing. There is

405
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:23,510
a discrete translation cemetery where, well, in

406
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:27,890
the case of writing the drawing, the ladies in the

407
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:30,470
circle, that translation would be called the

408
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:35,960
rotation of the sites going around here. Where? If

409
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:39,930
we would rotate the circle by an angle of two pi

410
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:42,530
over and over and is the number of sites that we

411
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:46,250
have, then the resulting lattice would be exactly

412
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:50,610
the same as the starting points. Which is what I

413
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:54,540
mean when I say there's a symmetry and we can so

414
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,110
it is harder to visualize this sort of.

415
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:05,110
Bending around in higher dimensions, but

416
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:09,790
mathematically what it corresponds to is. Placing

417
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:15,340
this simple cubic lattice with a constant fixed

418
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:18,160
distance between every point and all of its

419
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:21,580
nearest neighbors in all the dimensions that that

420
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:27,650
setup gets placed on a dimensional Taurus. So. The

421
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:30,980
two dimensional Taurus is probably what you think

422
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:35,710
of when you hear the word Taurus. I neglected to.

423
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:39,440
Pull up a picture of that.

424
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:44,130
I'm sure you've seen it before, it is essentially

425
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:47,190
the doughnut shape and in higher dimensions, you

426
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:52,470
simply have dimensional territory or hyper Tauri

427
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:55,470
that share the same property of being

428
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:59,950
typologically flat spaces with no curvature. So

429
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:03,550
that there's no complication with having this

430
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:07,150
simple Kubic Latisse living in this toroidal

431
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:09,760
structure that allows it to to wrap around

432
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,660
periodically.

433
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:19,350
And then the. The calculation of how many nearest

434
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:24,150
neighbors there are in the interacting energy that

435
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:27,390
we have to dealing with becomes a very simple and

436
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:29,820
very regular calculation.

437
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:36,680
Where no independence of the number of dimensions

438
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:40,760
we can see based on the pictures we've been

439
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,650
looking at in the general discussions around it,

440
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:51,620
that every site in every dimension. He has a link

441
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:53,930
connecting it to its nearest neighbor, both in the

442
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:58,160
forward orientation, in that dimension and the

443
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,680
backward orientation, so.

444
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:07,850
For every site, there are two times the number of

445
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:12,600
dimensions. Links connected to it are coming out

446
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:16,740
of it. So in this one dimensional case, we just

447
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:19,230
have the two links that connect to that site

448
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:20,910
circled in blue.

449
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:29,030
And. Similarly, if we had other dimensions in

450
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:31,340
which we could move, we would have the four

451
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:34,940
backward left, right up, down pairs of legs for

452
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:35,870
each of those,

453
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:40,760
but each of these links that are attached to each

454
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:44,810
site are also attached to another site. So.

455
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:51,160
Every link is essentially shared. Between.

456
00:32:54,470 --> 00:33:01,480
To. Different sites, so to avoid overcounting. We

457
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:05,380
have to combine both of those facts to consider

458
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:10,510
that the total number of links is that two D for

459
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:14,530
each site and then that counts each link twice

460
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:18,040
from each of the sites that it connects to. So

461
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:22,720
correcting for that gives just these times and

462
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,060
links in these dimensions. And I'll try to

463
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:29,560
remember to put little dots in the in the middle

464
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:32,260
of that sort of expression just so it doesn't look

465
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:35,860
like a differential factor. But an actual product

466
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:39,910
between the number of dimensions and the number of

467
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:45,070
sites, so that is how many terms there are in this

468
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:47,830
sum over the nearest thing, repairs that we've

469
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:53,440
been able to recast as a sum over links in the

470
00:33:53,440 --> 00:34:00,900
system. Is known as the the easy model, these

471
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:04,220
dimension's. Which has.

472
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:09,650
Now, really a fascinating history that. I've said

473
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:11,930
a bit about in in the text here, but.

474
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:20,560
It really, especially over the past half century

475
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:27,910
or so, it's become one of the foundational. Tools

476
00:34:28,450 --> 00:34:34,230
in. No, not merely statistical physics, but. Very

477
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:38,320
many branches of mathematical sciences and even

478
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:42,330
fields of research beyond the physical sciences

479
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:49,720
like sociology and in biology. As a an extremely

480
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:54,200
simple system that due to. It's interactive nature.

481
00:34:57,930 --> 00:35:01,440
Exhibits and can be used to model a very a vast

482
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:06,780
array of of different behaviors. So the where the

483
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,830
model was invented not by this easy fellow, but by

484
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:13,220
the guy named Lence, who was actually using his

485
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:16,880
PhD supervisor and Lence.

486
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:25,080
Came up with this model of. Of spins that can have

487
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,650
only two orientations and interact only with their

488
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:31,290
nearest neighbors and some regular Latisse

489
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:34,890
motivated by trying to explain the phenomenon of

490
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:39,750
feral magnetism. Which is one of those phase

491
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:44,580
transitions that I got mentioned earlier towards

492
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:46,350
the start of today, where?

493
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:54,870
As temperatures decrease for certain metals, they

494
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:57,810
pick up a an overall magnetization.

495
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:06,590
In the. No one had in mind with this model was

496
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:09,620
that the the spin's he was considering were the.

497
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:15,330
The individual magnetization of each individual

498
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:22,140
atom or molecule that composed this particular

499
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:24,390
ferromagnetic material,

500
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:30,480
iron being, I guess, the paradigmatic example,

501
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,300
which is what the Fero Charlamagne magnetism means,

502
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,850
I'm curious materials involving iron ore from

503
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:39,120
Latin. And the idea was that.

504
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:47,970
In one phase of these. Atoms in this lattice.

505
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:53,760
They're a. They're magnetization their spins would

506
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:57,120
all align in the same direction, adding up to the

507
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,580
overall large scale magnetization that had been

508
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:03,360
observed experimentally, whereas there may be some

509
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:09,030
other phase. Where? The the spins were pointing

510
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:10,790
all in different directions.

511
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:18,980
Leading to an overall cancellation of their

512
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:24,780
contributions to the magnetization Rich. Was

513
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:28,980
testing whether that was the case, was the project

514
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:33,570
that he assigned to students using whose solution

515
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:35,610
to the one dimensional system rather than the

516
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:38,430
three dimensions that that lens was originally

517
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:42,120
interested in, define that one dimensional using

518
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:46,010
model. And has turned out to be enormously

519
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:51,060
difficult to. To generalize to higher numbers of

520
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:51,870
dimensions.

521
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:54,610
And.

522
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:59,160
So what easing did was come up with an exact

523
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:02,070
expression, reclose for expression, for the

524
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:05,400
canonical position function of this simple model

525
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:10,380
with that energy from equation 118 in one

526
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:11,010
dimension.

527
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:20,000
And the two dimensional. A case. In the special

528
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,790
case for that, external magnetic field was exactly

529
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:26,750
vanishing, was not solved for another 20 years

530
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:32,000
until. This fellow named Morrisson Singer and

531
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:37,160
eventual Nobel laureate carried out a. Famously

532
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:41,600
difficult calculation that. You know, it really is

533
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:45,260
one of the most famous calculations of 20th

534
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:49,040
century mathematical physics and sort of up there

535
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:53,060
on the scale of the equals and C squared in the.

536
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:56,810
In the physics community, if not in popular

537
00:38:56,810 --> 00:39:02,390
consciousness, it was a remarkable achievement to

538
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:05,960
exactly solve. Even this very simple two

539
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:09,230
dimensional model, which is maybe the key points

540
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:09,770
to.

541
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:15,770
To wrap up with today, maybe will make things a

542
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:18,140
bit short today and pick up next week with.

543
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:22,540
Looking at the phases of the easing phase,

544
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:26,110
transition between them, where the sorts of

545
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:31,300
numerical simulations that will be included in the

546
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:35,170
week 11 material can play a useful role. But in

547
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:39,590
terms of. Of mathematically or analytically

548
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:43,790
solving this interacting spin system, the easy

549
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:44,240
model.

550
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:50,520
We can see that. Now that we no longer have the

551
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:53,730
ability to consider each individual spent in

552
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:56,970
isolation, not interacting with any of the others.

553
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:02,070
We can no longer factories or break up the

554
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:04,980
calculation into just repeating that simple one

555
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:07,980
spin calculation over and over and over again, we

556
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:12,120
have to keep track of all in spins at once. And

557
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,970
the precision function then depends on every

558
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:18,360
possible microstates that is defined by every

559
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:22,020
possible orientation of all of those and spins,

560
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:25,440
each of which can be either up or down. So a total

561
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:31,530
of to the end terms. In this.

562
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:36,370
There's some overlapping configurations that

563
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:39,190
defines the partition function, which grows

564
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:45,840
exponentially quickly. So if we. If we back off

565
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,750
from our goal of thinking about ten to the power

566
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:51,540
funny three particles that are in everyday

567
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:56,220
materials and think about just say No. Thousand

568
00:40:56,220 --> 00:41:01,060
twenty three spin's. In this song that is is

569
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:04,510
written here on this page, there are something

570
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:11,560
like 10 to the. 310 power. Terms where I'm

571
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:14,530
breaking up these summations in the exponential to

572
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:17,470
count the total number of terms that would have to

573
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:22,690
be computed in order to really evaluate this

574
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:26,830
function, either mathematically or analytically or

575
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:31,900
by a numerical calculation. And those numerical

576
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:36,160
calculations. They turn out to be.

577
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:42,000
Of great utility in more than two dimensions where

578
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:46,770
there is no known exact solution to the U.S. model

579
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:52,680
in three or any larger number of dimensions,

580
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:55,650
except for the infinite dimensional limit, which

581
00:41:55,650 --> 00:42:00,960
is somewhat of a mathematical curiosity. What were

582
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,320
you even mean by an infinite number of dimensions?

583
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:14,660
But there is. Yeah, as we will see next week, an

584
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:18,050
enormous amount of work using all sorts of tools

585
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:21,170
at the cutting edge of water research even to

586
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:25,190
evaluate interaction systems like the using model,

587
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:29,510
let alone the more complicated variants that we

588
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:32,660
could consider describing or consider defining,

589
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:35,870
say, by allowing the ideal gasses that we've

590
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:38,330
worked with to have particles that interact with

591
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:42,890
each other or by generalizing these things to

592
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:45,380
degrees of freedom that can take continuously

593
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:48,740
value or continuous values, maybe having a

594
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,610
continuous length or continuous orientation rather

595
00:42:52,610 --> 00:42:55,700
than being simply plus one for an opposing spin or

596
00:42:55,700 --> 00:43:00,980
minus one for a down 20 spin. So I'll wrap up with

597
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:04,670
maybe that key point that interactive systems are

598
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:07,970
enormously difficult to handle mathematically and

599
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:11,150
there are whole fields of of mathematics that.

600
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:17,180
Worked on just this question and now we'll see

601
00:43:18,510 --> 00:43:21,360
next week wrapping up the module, how the

602
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:25,110
statistical tools, the statistical ensembles, the

603
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:28,660
partition function, the free energy canonical

604
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:31,710
degree and canonical micro canonical ensembles can

605
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:34,770
all be brought to bear even in these more

606
00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:38,250
complicated settings of interactive systems.

607
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:44,170
So the one last call for immediate questions,

608
00:43:44,890 --> 00:43:49,090
we've asked for office hours later on today after

609
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:52,570
saving this recording and shutting down the

610
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:56,670
meeting. This is the good place to stop, I think,

611
00:43:56,670 --> 00:43:58,230
for today.
