00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:04,540
Hello and welcome back to Statistical Physics.

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:07,710
This is the second video for week nine in the

3
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:11,670
module, wrapping up the brief summary of context,

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,550
motivations and key learning outcomes for this

5
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:18,060
week's material on quantum gases of fermions,

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,690
which I will bring back up onto the screen here,

7
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:27,120
picking up where previous video left off at the

8
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:30,930
Fermi function, which had been introduced by

9
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:35,910
putting the the large scale macroscopic or

10
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,130
thermodynamic properties of the system that into

11
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:41,430
this equation of state. In this case, the average

12
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:44,400
particle density number of particles divided by

13
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,960
the volume expressing that in terms of an integral

14
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,240
over the particle energies with a non relativistic

15
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:59,100
setting for massive particles with relatively

16
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:02,550
little energy that is given just by their momentum

17
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:08,160
squared divided by twice the mass and in the set

18
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:12,000
up here, keeping the cost of factors separate from

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,660
the family function, we saw that at the very

20
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:17,880
function shown here resembles the average

21
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,180
occupation number, which means that its behavior

22
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,570
at low temperatures shown by the solid black curve

23
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:26,580
in this plot we went through in some detail in the

24
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:27,540
previous video

25
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,600
corresponds simply to a step function where all of

26
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,690
the energy levels that have energy is less than

27
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:40,680
the chemical potential. You are occupied or filled

28
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:45,180
by the maximum single possible for me on that they

29
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,060
can contain and all of the energy levels with

30
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,540
energies greater than the chemical potential have

31
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:55,440
an occupation. Number zero, they are unoccupied or

32
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:01,940
empty. And this approximation expressing the

33
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:07,200
family function as a step function that is one for

34
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:12,600
low energies and zero for higher energies at small

35
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:17,460
temperatures, provides the sort of dramatic

36
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:20,850
simplification that allows these calculations to

37
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:26,790
be computed in the space of these gaps, providing

38
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:31,410
both the particle number as well as the average

39
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:36,260
energy density where the. Integral to a computer

40
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:39,670
for the energy density is going to differ just by

41
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:44,770
an extra factor of the energy showing up in the

42
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:49,270
argument right there. So an energy or a power of

43
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:52,060
energy, each of the three hands, rather than the

44
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:56,350
square root, which is exactly as we saw for the

45
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:59,080
energy density compared to the particle. No

46
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:05,380
density for the photon gas last week. So that is a

47
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:09,970
generic connection between the energy and particle

48
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:13,270
number, regardless of whether particles are bosons,

49
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:16,110
fermions, not relativistic or ultra relativistic.

50
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:19,900
And what we're going through this, it's worth

51
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:24,550
highlighting the Fermi energy, which at low

52
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:28,120
temperatures is simply the chemical potential and

53
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:33,430
is the boundary between those filled energy levels

54
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:36,700
with energy is smaller than the free energy and

55
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:41,020
the empty energy levels with higher energies that

56
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:48,910
is given by the particle. No density in over the

57
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:52,930
race to the power of two thirds coming just from

58
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:57,280
converting the particle. No density computed above.

59
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:02,260
And by carrying out the analogous computation for

60
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:07,450
the internal energy density, you could find that

61
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:12,910
the average energy for each of these particles at

62
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:17,380
low temperatures is given by just a little over

63
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:22,360
half of the Fermi Energy particular nice, odd

64
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:26,140
round fraction of three fifths

65
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:33,160
relating the average energy to the average

66
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,720
particle. No. In the rest of the way to the

67
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,630
equation of state requires computing, the pressure,

68
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:43,860
which requires fixing both the entropy and

69
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:47,190
particle number in the entropy, is actually an

70
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:50,790
interesting case in this very low temperature

71
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:54,990
regime where if we have all of the energy levels

72
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:58,800
up to the Fermi energy filled, all of the energy

73
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,010
levels with higher energies are unoccupied. That

74
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:05,600
is a single microstates for this quantum system.

75
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:08,880
And it turns out to be the only micro state that

76
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:14,580
we are actually. Accessing with a non-zero

77
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,760
probability in the the limit of low temperatures.

78
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,230
So expressing the entropy in the generic way as

79
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:26,430
the sum over my cross over the probabilities of

80
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:29,910
occupying microstates, there's only a single term

81
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:32,880
in the sum, and it is one times the log of one,

82
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:36,390
which is simply zero. So the entropy of a low

83
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:40,720
temperature firmly on gas is zero. And that gives

84
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:46,960
direct relations between the pressure, the energy

85
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,020
density and the number density, which if we plug

86
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:53,200
in the very energy in place of the chemical

87
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:57,850
potential, hmu and define the density as a row.

88
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:01,960
Just a new symbol for this same concept. We've

89
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:05,590
been discussing the average particle number per

90
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:09,790
unit volume. There is an interesting relation

91
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:14,410
between the pressure and density, which does not

92
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:18,520
vanish as the temperature goes to zero. This is

93
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:22,480
also the case, as we can see, for the energy of

94
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,820
the gas and its particles. That also remains

95
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:31,150
non-zero in the limit of a vanishing temperature,

96
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:36,280
which is a sharp contrast with the classical non

97
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:40,240
relativistic gas where we saw that the energy was

98
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,630
three 1/2 times empty and vanished as that

99
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:46,480
temperature goes to zero. And similarly, the

100
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:50,980
pressure was given by empty overview by the ideal

101
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:54,580
gas law equals empty and also vanished in zero

102
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,700
temperature limit. And that is not the case for

103
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:01,360
fermions simply because it's only possible to have

104
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,620
a single ferme on occupying any energy level with

105
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:09,990
that lowest energy that we can set to zero. If we

106
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:14,310
have more fermions of that coming from a positive

107
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:17,280
chemical potential, then we have to have fermions

108
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,980
occupying energy levels with higher volumes of the

109
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:23,970
energy, even an absolute zero temperature, which

110
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:29,130
leaves a strictly positive average energy density

111
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:33,660
and a strictly positive pressure, as is shown in

112
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:37,200
the zero temperature limit of of this plant here,

113
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:43,050
where instead of going straight to zero like a

114
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:47,610
classical gas, the pressure for the fermions gas

115
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:51,120
ends up at a positive value at zero temperature

116
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,970
and in the high temperature limit where it

117
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:58,620
approaches the classical behavior. We see the

118
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:01,920
onset of that linear dependence that we would

119
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:06,970
expect from our previous work. So that is the the

120
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,330
key takeaway for low temperature for on is

121
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:13,870
compared to the high temperature, a classical case

122
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:18,610
for these non relativistic particles. And there is

123
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:22,180
some discussion here of some physical effects of

124
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:26,170
this non-zero pressure at low temperatures, which

125
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:30,500
in. Astrophysical contexts allows for

126
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:33,020
a

127
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,360
famous cosmic phenomenon known as a type one, a

128
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:42,560
supernova that precedes briefly in the following

129
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:47,180
way the type of a supernova involves what's called

130
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:51,200
a white dwarf star, which is a star that has

131
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:57,200
burned all of its its nuclear fuel. That's in

132
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:00,560
stars like our sun that are shining brightly and

133
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:03,410
producing lots of heat. They're doing that for

134
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:07,100
nuclear fusion involving hydrogen and helium. And

135
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,640
eventually, after a long amount of time, a star

136
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,400
made up all of that hydrogen and helium fuel and

137
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:18,940
no longer be able to generate heat and light and

138
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:23,870
energy and pressure through the source of nuclear

139
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:27,440
fusion reactions. And that is what characterizes

140
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:33,980
the white dwarf star, all of the. Fuel for those

141
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:36,560
hydrogen and helium nuclear reactions in a white

142
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,730
dwarf has been consumed and is no longer providing

143
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:43,010
the energy that can counterbalance the enormous

144
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:46,640
gravitational attraction of the huge amount of

145
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,850
matter present in these stars. And what keeps the

146
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:53,150
star from collapsing all the way down to a black

147
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:59,120
hole under the weight of its of its mass of matter

148
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:06,350
is precisely the non-zero pressure of the of the

149
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:10,220
gas of the electrons, which are fermions that this

150
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,360
star contains.

151
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:19,050
And in the in the case where this white wordstar

152
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:21,480
may be part of a binary system with some companya

153
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:25,470
that is still burning, it's nuclear fuel and

154
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:29,160
emitting heat and light and matter, that matter

155
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:33,340
can gradually accumulate on this way for a start

156
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:36,960
up being held up by the zero temperature pressure

157
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:42,270
of its four, its low temperature, me on gas up to

158
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:45,240
the point that the pressure becomes so large that

159
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:49,590
new types of fusion reactions involving carbon and

160
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:53,370
oxygen rather than hydrogen and helium are able to

161
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:57,690
begin. And once they begin, they proceed very

162
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:01,170
quickly. And in the space of just a few seconds,

163
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:04,950
they release something like five billion times the

164
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:08,970
amount of energy that our sun is putting out,

165
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:14,940
which is precisely the supernova explosion that we

166
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:18,330
can observe in the sky and can actually use to

167
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:22,020
establish the existence of a mysterious phenomenon

168
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,340
known as dark energy is showing that the universe

169
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:28,710
is not only expanding, but is expanding more and

170
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:33,750
more rapidly as time goes on. A discovery from the

171
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:37,110
late 90s that was awarded the Nobel Prize about 10

172
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:40,620
years ago. Now, one interesting thing about these

173
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:42,780
Wentworth stars that I glossed over in the

174
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:45,600
interests of time is that.

175
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:51,630
Even though their temperatures are small compared

176
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:57,300
to their energies, they have a fear of the energy

177
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,930
of something like a billion Kelvin. The

178
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:03,510
temperatures in the interior of the white dwarf

179
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:07,230
are about 10 million Kelvin, which is relatively

180
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:12,330
large by our everyday standards. It's still small

181
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:15,660
enough compared to the very energy identified as

182
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:19,260
the chemical potential that we can approximate

183
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:22,050
white dwarfs very well as a zero temperature

184
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:28,080
firmly on gas. But the temperature is actually so

185
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:33,330
large that if we convert units to units of mass or

186
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:36,120
emit our mega electron volts.

187
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:41,420
You find that the Fermoy energy, the chemical

188
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:45,110
potential of this electron gas is comparable to

189
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:50,570
the electron reste energy itself, suggesting that

190
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:55,370
relativistic effects may be worth considering and.

191
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,230
To go through this last section quite quickly, the

192
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:04,680
key takeaway in the context of a relativistic

193
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:08,310
fermoy on gas is that it behaves much like the

194
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:12,330
relativistic photon gas we consider last week. We

195
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:15,990
can express the energy in terms of the frequency.

196
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:22,270
Of these massless fermions, an example of which in

197
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:26,440
physics are given by neutrinos and carrying out

198
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:30,940
these same. Considerations and manipulations, as

199
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:35,110
for the photon. Yes, we conclude that here the

200
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:38,290
chemical potential is zero here to an excellent

201
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:44,500
approximation and. The integration over the

202
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:49,090
frequencies of these relativistic electrons

203
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:53,320
produces expressions that differ from the the case

204
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:57,220
of the photon gas only in the relative sine

205
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,450
between the two terms in the denominator. And

206
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:04,810
again, the energy density and particle no density

207
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:09,670
differ only by a factor of that energy. Each FA

208
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:16,790
Omega showing up in the inter grand here and

209
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:22,990
carrying out these integrals. Again, these are fun

210
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:25,990
integrals that can be looked up or computed

211
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:29,620
through some symbolic mathematic program like

212
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:35,270
maple or mathematical. And computing the pressure

213
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,490
again gives a equation of state very much like the

214
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:43,550
ideal gas law, just with a slightly different

215
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:47,930
causal factor involving the remains at a function

216
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:52,400
that comes out to be not so different from the

217
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,410
classical case that it will reduce to at high high

218
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:02,590
temperatures. So that is where we will end with

219
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:07,480
not interacting ideal gases and other idealise

220
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:11,230
systems of not interacting particles and the

221
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:15,460
remainder of the module after this will take just

222
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:19,930
a quick look at appreciating the roles and effects

223
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:23,200
of interactions, both in the types of phenomenon

224
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,230
or phenomena that they can produce, such as phase

225
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:29,080
transitions, as well as the practical matter of

226
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:34,690
how they complicate the analysis and calculations

227
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:37,960
that we would have to do in statistical physics in

228
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:41,560
order to make predictions for interacting systems.
