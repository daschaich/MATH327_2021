00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:04,760
Hello and welcome back to Statistical Physics.

2
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:08,150
We'll do a couple of videos on the week six

3
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:11,000
material introducing the grand canonical ensemble

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,610
and we'll do that with the screen shared following

5
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:20,570
the same pattern as last week. And to start by

6
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:24,350
putting this week in the context of the overall

7
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:29,690
module this week, six on the grand canonical

8
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:33,700
ensemble is. Playing the final piece, the

9
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,060
foundations for the module, we've discussed that

10
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:40,300
we are going to be looking at three particular

11
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:43,390
statistical ensembles, which are probability

12
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:46,480
spaces for systems, either physical or

13
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:51,640
hypothetical, that sample their microstates as

14
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:55,030
they evolve in time subject to certain constraints.

15
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:59,260
And those obvious constraints are conservation of

16
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,650
energy and particle number, which define the micro

17
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:06,220
canonical ensemble, but require that a micro

18
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:09,520
canonical system be completely isolated from the

19
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:14,050
rest of the universe. And if we bring that system

20
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:17,530
into thermal contact with its surroundings and

21
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:21,130
allow it to exchange energy while still preserving

22
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:24,130
a fixed number of particles, that defines the

23
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:28,120
canonical ensemble that we saw a few weeks ago and

24
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:32,290
then applied to analyze ideal gases and the role

25
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:35,590
in thermodynamic cycles. And now we take the next

26
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:41,140
step and allow our system to exchange both energy

27
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:45,280
and particles with its surroundings, which defines

28
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,420
the grand canonical ensemble. So now, instead of

29
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:52,300
just a thermal reservoir that we had in the

30
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:56,050
canonical ensemble, we promote that to a particle

31
00:01:56,050 --> 00:02:01,360
reservoir, a large external system that our system

32
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,930
of interest is in contact with and can exchange

33
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:11,350
both energy and particles. And just in the same

34
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:16,090
way that the thermal reservoir, in the canonical

35
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:20,460
context, fixed the temperature of our system and

36
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:26,500
that fixed temperature took the role of the sort

37
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,900
of constraint that was initially played by the

38
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,720
internal energy and the micro canonical case. We

39
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,700
expect that. By exchanging particles with this

40
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:39,300
large external reservoir or some other quantity

41
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,510
will be kept fixed in that quantity, turns out to

42
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:47,010
be something known as chemical potential. Which is

43
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,370
unlike the temperature is not something that we

44
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,820
have the sort of day to day experience of working

45
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:58,050
with, but mathematically it comes from very much

46
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:01,200
the same sort of considerations. How does the

47
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:07,000
entropy of the system respond to changes in the

48
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:11,010
the control parameters? The temperature we saw all

49
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:14,400
the way back in week two is defined as the inverse

50
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,350
of the interviews, response to a change in the

51
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:19,410
energy with a fixed number of particles. And to

52
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:21,780
define the chemical potential, we just interchange

53
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,950
the role of the energy and particle no in that

54
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:30,360
relation. Also adding a couple of features here, a

55
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:34,140
overall factor of the temperature and a negative

56
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:39,300
sign, both of which you can explain qualitatively

57
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:43,290
and then see how they are applied and how they

58
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,860
impact the quantitative mathematics.

59
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:53,530
So the temperature. To start with that, we can

60
00:03:53,530 --> 00:04:01,300
recognize this factor of tee times deaths from the

61
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:05,890
first law of thermodynamics. This has the same

62
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:09,280
dimensions as entropy and maybe I should not be

63
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:12,580
jumping around too much in these notes, since you

64
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:19,830
didn't have to skim back to to where we were. And.

65
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:24,280
The negative sign here means that with a positive

66
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,460
temperature for a natural system, we generically

67
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:30,760
expect the chemical potential as a whole to have a

68
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:36,460
negative value. That is because we've seen both in

69
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:39,040
general and in particular, examples of the spin

70
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,480
system, an ideal gas that as we have more degrees

71
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,850
of freedom, more particles, those particles can

72
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:48,670
contain more information and that additional

73
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:53,440
information corresponds to a larger entropy. So

74
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,500
this partial derivative, how the entropy changes

75
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,690
with respect to the number of particles

76
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:01,450
generically arises even in fixed energy.

77
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:07,730
So what we have are generically negative chemical

78
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:12,320
potentials, and the negative sign is motivated in

79
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:19,170
order to. Ensure that particles flow from regions

80
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:21,540
or systems with larger values of the chemical

81
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:24,090
potential over here, larger means less negative,

82
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:27,300
smaller in magnitude with a negative sign, and

83
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,040
they flow from those.

84
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:35,100
Larger chemical potentials to regions with smaller

85
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,640
chemical potentials as though they were, say,

86
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:40,230
balls rolling down the hill, going from a higher

87
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:43,290
altitude to a lower one. And that, of course, is

88
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:45,870
the same thing that happens with the temperature.

89
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,660
Energy flows from hotter systems of higher

90
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,030
temperature to colder systems with lower

91
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:51,660
temperature.

92
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,170
And by having the negative side there, we get the

93
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:58,390
same behavior for the chemical potential.

94
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,640
Whereas if we had chosen a different convention

95
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:05,860
where the chemical potential was defined without

96
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,630
that negative sign, which is mathematically

97
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:10,150
legitimate, you would have had to keep in mind

98
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:13,180
that particles would have flown. That flowed in

99
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:17,200
that case from lower to high, in contrast to the

100
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,150
temperature flying from high to low. So what we

101
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:23,600
have in this standard convention. Is putting the

102
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:27,380
temperature and chemical potential on the same

103
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:30,620
intuitive foundation so that we can think of both

104
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:33,650
of them in the same way, governing, on the one

105
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:36,350
hand, the energy flow and on the other hand, the

106
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:39,920
particle flow of the system, both of which flow

107
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:44,960
from large to small values. So with that chemical

108
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,900
potential, we are in a position to formally define

109
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,630
a grand canonical ensemble as a statistical

110
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:54,020
ensemble where both the energy and particle number

111
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:56,150
are allowed to fluctuate and are no longer

112
00:06:56,150 --> 00:07:01,640
conserved. But they always fluctuate by exchange

113
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,310
with a large external reservoir that fixes both

114
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:07,250
the temperature of the system and its chemical

115
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:11,000
potential. Which we will always represent with the

116
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,900
Greek letter MU.

117
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:20,390
And now let me charge through. The next step in

118
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:25,970
this this week's material, which is going through

119
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:29,180
very much the same mathematical consideration as

120
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,370
we did when introducing the canonical ensemble

121
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:34,760
back in week three, which is proposing a well

122
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,190
motivated on ZATZ for the form of that particle

123
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:40,070
reservoir, and then showing that the details of

124
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:44,060
the ANZAAS all drop out in the behavior of the

125
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:47,390
grand canonical ensemble, allowing us to describe

126
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:50,690
the system just with reference to that fixed

127
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:53,720
temperature and fixed chemical potential with no

128
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,260
other information even knowable about the external

129
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:02,580
reservoir that fixes those parameters. And we do

130
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:07,610
this so. The same spirit of baking a well

131
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:10,490
motivated on size by having a reservoir be the

132
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:14,110
same stuff as the system, but just more of it. We

133
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,330
again introduce a large number of replicas of our

134
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,480
system single out one of them as the system we

135
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,150
actually care about and all of the others form

136
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:28,220
that reservoir as illustrated in a way that does

137
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:30,890
not quite fit on my screen.

138
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:33,560
Here,

139
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:39,870
so this is a very similar picture to the replicas

140
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:43,510
that we considered for systems in week three here.

141
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:47,280
By contrast, we picture an ideal gas with

142
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:50,310
particles like particles of gas bouncing around

143
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:53,910
with some momentum and corresponding energy. And

144
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:57,330
hear all of the boxes that we draw around each of

145
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:02,130
these replicas is fictitious. It's not something

146
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:06,210
real. It's something that we mentally impose on

147
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:08,520
the system in order to organize our calculation.

148
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:12,660
And the particles are able to freely move from any

149
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:16,370
of these boxes, any of these replicas to any other.

150
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:19,380
So the particle numbers, as well as the energy in

151
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:22,800
each replica is fluctuating, subject to

152
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,810
constraints on the overall system of the small

153
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:31,710
subsystem of interest, plus the larger reservoir

154
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:36,630
which that overall total system is we can think of.

155
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:40,050
That is the entire universe, and that is still

156
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:43,600
subject to conservation of energy and conservation

157
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,490
particle number.

158
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:52,250
If we represent the system in terms of the

159
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:55,100
occupation numbers and occupation probabilities,

160
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:58,370
recalling that the occupation number is the number

161
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:03,590
of replicas that occupy a particular microstates

162
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:09,980
of the single. System of interest. Is the

163
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:12,620
occupation probability is then the corresponding

164
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:18,130
probability that. He randomly chosen replica will

165
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:22,660
be in the corresponding microstates then a lot of

166
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:25,200
the mathematics works out exactly the same as in

167
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:27,640
the canonical case. So we don't need to repeat

168
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,670
that here. The number of microstates just counts

169
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,700
how all of those replicas can be assigned to all

170
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:37,630
of the microstates. And if we assume that the

171
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:41,500
number of replicas and each occupation number is a

172
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,460
very large number, then we get the same result.

173
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:48,590
For the total energy of the system, plus its

174
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:54,170
reservoir, so we now have the usual task of

175
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:57,140
maximizing that entropy corresponding to

176
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:00,770
thermodynamic equilibrium, subject to the

177
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:03,080
constraints, two of which we've seen before.

178
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:08,870
Probabilities have to add to one in the energy. Of

179
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:12,320
each replica, which we can express in terms of the

180
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,540
occupation probabilities, has to add up to the

181
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:18,110
conserved total energy of the universe. And we

182
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,420
have this one new constraints that now the

183
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,720
fluctuating number of particles in each replica,

184
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:27,950
which we can also cast in the form of a sum over

185
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:30,560
occupation probabilities, has to add up to the

186
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,650
conserved total number of particles in the

187
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:37,880
universe. So now when we do our maximization, we

188
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:43,400
need three legrange multipliers and imposing those

189
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:48,860
three constraints then fixes the form of each of

190
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:52,520
those three three parameters in terms of the

191
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:57,380
overall total energy and particle number that is

192
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:00,830
conserved in the system. So that's a

193
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:04,280
straightforward, if sometimes messy calculation.

194
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:11,640
And at the end of it we find. That's the parameter

195
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,790
Beita is exactly the same inverse temperature as

196
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:20,220
we found for the canonical. Ensemble, the new

197
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:23,790
parameter Gamma is not surprisingly related to the

198
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:26,340
new fixed quantity mbewe the chemical potential,

199
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:31,320
and there is a proportionality factor of the

200
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:31,980
temperature.

201
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:38,110
Essentially providing the the appropriate units in

202
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:43,540
these relations and the final Louvre's multiplier

203
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:46,840
can be identified as the grand canonical partition

204
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:50,740
function, a very direct analogue to the canonical

205
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,570
partition function that we've been working with

206
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:55,630
for the past three weeks, which is given by the

207
00:12:55,630 --> 00:13:00,190
sum over microstates of this generalized bowsman

208
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:06,010
factor, which includes not only the energy of the

209
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:09,220
micro state being sold over, but also its particle

210
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:14,140
number waited by the chemical potential. So this

211
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:17,560
is the fundamental quantity from which we will

212
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:20,770
derive all the other quantities of interest.

213
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,520
Internal energy, entropy, particle number and so

214
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,940
on, which I will make a separate video to keep

215
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:30,640
these relatively bite sized.
