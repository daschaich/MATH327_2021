1
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:09,290
And I think while we wait for a few more folks to

2
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:12,020
trickle in just after the hour, it's worth getting

3
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:15,770
that recording started and setting up some or

4
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:19,010
going through some of the usual logistics,

5
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:25,970
including the usual initial question from the

6
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:29,030
people everywhere asking.

7
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:35,350
If there are any questions you want to see

8
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:40,210
discussed this week, where I do already have notes

9
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:45,970
of the question that came in on Monday to discuss

10
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:54,520
equation fifty four on what pages that page 63 of

11
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:57,820
the notes, which is the sixth page of the week for

12
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:02,050
lecture notes on. Fairly certain we will get to

13
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:08,020
that today. I just want to wrap up a bit of what

14
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:12,700
you were discussing with the energy levels for the

15
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:18,220
ideal gas in a cubic volume before moving on to

16
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:21,910
those derived quantities, the internal energy and

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,660
entropy.

18
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:35,970
And while. I have that poll up and running and.

19
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:39,700
Give you a few minutes to get any thoughts in

20
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:44,410
there can also go through the other aspects of

21
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:48,220
logistics for this week that, as you know, the

22
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,760
first part of the computer project was do just

23
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,210
about 36 hours ago. And most of those have been

24
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:58,660
submitted. There's still some time to submit

25
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,300
layouts for those of you who have not yet got

26
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:07,300
those in with some late penalties that are mild by

27
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:11,470
my standards. And since that is now hopefully out

28
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:18,670
of the way, the next homework assignment is

29
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,640
uploaded and available on canvas of all, depending

30
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,370
on your notification settings, you should have

31
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:31,090
gotten a notification about it when it was updated

32
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:35,530
earlier this week. Just going to the assignments

33
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:42,130
homework one and it is usual PDF linked from that

34
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:48,000
page in canvas. And available for you to work on

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,790
do at the end of Tuesday, 16th of March, so a week

36
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:58,260
from next Tuesday or 12 days from today.

37
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:09,330
And in equation 54, we will get to in due course,

38
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:15,540
but let's let me move on from that open request

39
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:18,390
for questions to.

40
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:24,560
Just wrapping up what we were discussing last week

41
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,640
with the.

42
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,680
Energy levels for.

43
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:38,830
This ideal gas in a cubic volume where you ran out

44
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:44,080
of time just before I could ask what I expected to

45
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,670
be, the last quick question about that, which I

46
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:55,240
will now bring up on that poll everywhere and.

47
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:03,440
That now leads that going back to this portion of

48
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:06,230
the notes just where we ended last time.

49
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:14,670
We saw that the three lowest energy levels coming

50
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:19,950
from these highest momenta are on sites to get a

51
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:23,700
well defined partitioned function for an ideal gas.

52
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,410
Those three energy levels for all integer

53
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:32,010
multiples of this quantity, each are squared pi

54
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:35,280
squared over 2m elsewhere where each bar is

55
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,670
Planck's constant and is the mass of the particles

56
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:42,960
in the gas and oil is the length of each side of

57
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:48,520
the cubic volume that the gas can find within. And

58
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:52,450
the question the follow up question to that is,

59
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:58,480
are all of the energy levels for this single

60
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:02,170
particle gas evenly spaced in general the way that

61
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,360
these three lowest ones are?

62
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:19,100
Debating which of these screens is the best to. To

63
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,060
have on the share,

64
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,500
let's stick with this one. You know, to keep an

65
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,230
eye on the responses.

66
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,410
Separately.

67
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:19,360
That's.

68
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:36,560
Mr..

69
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:23,560
Not many responses have come in yet, so. Continue

70
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:28,430
waiting in case you are. Reviewing the.

71
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:33,650
The general result from last week

72
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,300
or sorry, last time, one day this week.

73
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:05,320
So far, there's one response which is in agreement

74
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:10,390
with itself, so there's a 100 percent. Choice for

75
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:13,700
one of those four options. That's.

76
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:21,010
Why, I'm just giving it another few seconds for

77
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:22,090
those who are.

78
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:31,560
Still considering. How these energy, how these

79
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:35,280
disparities, energy levels work for just a single

80
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:39,970
particle in this volume. With our arms out for the

81
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:40,540
momentum.

82
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,960
Well, at this point, it's. May have gotten all the

83
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,050
responses that are going to come in there. There

84
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:35,840
are a serial number now. So if we look at.

85
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,570
What we have here, there's now an even split

86
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:46,790
between two of these options where if we.

87
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:56,090
Just recall, the general form for the energy is

88
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:59,750
coming from those inventor. You have.

89
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:08,230
From last time. It is a. Kay.

90
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:23,060
And the fact that the. Energies depend quadratics

91
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:28,550
on these integer, okay, tell us that not all of

92
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,530
the energies are going to be evenly spaced. They

93
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:34,970
will, in generality be quite radically spaced. And

94
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:39,710
the question is, when does that set in? Responses

95
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:45,720
have switched around now and. If we look at the

96
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:52,500
options for these three energy levels here. You

97
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,050
saw last time that they corresponded to.

98
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:03,400
These values of the Vector's K being all Xeros

99
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:07,900
having one non-zero entry or two and six or in

100
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,870
permutations thereof if we have.

101
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:21,540
Talk of one one, one that energy is three times

102
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:27,930
the usual units, which I'll call that a lowercase

103
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:34,950
E. And we can go on to consider. To.

104
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:41,500
Zero zero with an energy of four.

105
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:49,840
Two one zero. With an energy. Five.

106
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:01,850
And it looks like I actually made a mistake in the

107
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:04,760
counting of the whole everywhere problem problems

108
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:08,510
made these quiz question, which may be why there

109
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:11,090
were relatively few responses. When we get up to

110
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:17,300
two on one, that energy is 60, but there is no way

111
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:20,690
to get seven units of energy from these integer

112
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:24,890
squares. So after that seventh level, which is an

113
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:26,870
energy of six, which is where that miscounting

114
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:32,330
came from, I apologize for we jump straight up to

115
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:38,030
to come to an energy of eight units. So that

116
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,840
hopefully is now.

117
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:47,210
Clear to see, having written down the overall

118
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:49,220
formula went.

119
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,730
But a bit longer than I expected. So let's set

120
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:57,870
aside the.

121
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:06,120
Individual energy for this particle and for this

122
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:12,880
ideal gas and cubic container and skip through all

123
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,580
of these manipulations going from the.

124
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:23,180
Disparities moment back to continuous moments in

125
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:27,210
integrating over those to get to the partition

126
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:31,290
functions for distinguishable and

127
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:35,820
indistinguishable particles in the gas, we're now

128
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:38,190
approaching the question that was asked about

129
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:42,990
equation. Fifty four coming up. Before we get

130
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:45,600
there, though, let me.

131
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:55,620
Ask one quick question that did not appear in. The

132
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:57,840
asynchronous material, which is.

133
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:08,840
If I can get to it up here, what is the heat

134
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:15,660
capacity for this ideal gas with in particles? And

135
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:18,830
as we saw in equation fifty four, that this

136
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:21,620
doesn't depend on whether or not those particles

137
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:26,810
are distinguishable or indistinguishable. It is a

138
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:34,130
fixed answer for both cases. And since that was

139
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:38,870
not something you were asked to consider in

140
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:41,240
advance, give you a.

141
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:47,040
A minute or two to think about it.

142
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,970
Responses have started coming in and.

143
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:10,830
We'll wait for more to accumulate.

144
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,060
Spacings.

145
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,440
I'll make this the

146
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:51,300
last call for responses which may be slowing down.

147
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:30,110
And there is, again, a.

148
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,410
Even split between two of these options, so

149
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:45,250
I'll go through this briefly that recalling the

150
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,780
heat capacity.

151
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,210
Is.

152
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:58,110
The derivative of the internal energy with respect

153
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:01,830
to the temperature at a fixed volume, then this

154
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:07,920
equation 54 gives us the derivative of T with T is

155
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:14,340
one in the constant three has N comes out as the

156
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:22,580
heat capacity. And that was one of those options

157
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:28,070
that I'll select there, and that brings us to the

158
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:35,050
equation 54 that. Was asked about, so I'll turn on

159
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:36,280
the open

160
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,250
response polls from that back on while we look at

161
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:43,870
this equation. Fifty four.

162
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:52,790
In more detail, and I suspect the question has to

163
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:58,070
do with this footnote here and the observation

164
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,270
that

165
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:05,840
in contrast to the spin system considered at the

166
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:10,190
end of the week, three material introducing the

167
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:16,840
canonical ensemble. There we saw that the energy

168
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:20,830
and the entropy were both different for

169
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:24,070
distinguishable versus indistinguishable particles,

170
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,070
in this case distinguishable versus

171
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:30,730
indistinguishable spins. This is the energy on the

172
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:35,330
left. And the entropy on the right now that we're

173
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:39,290
looking at an ideal gas, we find that the energy

174
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,800
is always the same independent of the

175
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:46,400
distinguished ability or indistinguishably of the

176
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,060
particles. In this ideal gas, though, there is

177
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:56,030
still a difference in the entropy. So in a sense,

178
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:59,840
that difference of the entropy is what we may have

179
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:04,700
expected coming from last week and the. Identical

180
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:08,000
internal energies are potentially more surprising

181
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:10,220
in this footnote here, mentions, if you were

182
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:16,530
surprised by. That results that the reason for it

183
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:21,420
is it has to do with how the microstates match up

184
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:25,890
or how the partitioned function matches up between

185
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:29,580
these cases of distinguishable and

186
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,950
indistinguishable particles, which

187
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:38,460
takes us back up to the previous section of the

188
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:41,850
nose where we were computing those two partition

189
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:43,560
functions for the case of distinguishable and

190
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:47,850
indistinguishable particles. And just as a quick

191
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:53,850
reminder that I will. Reuse this box as empty

192
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:59,400
space to to scratch in rather than confining

193
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:06,150
myself to the margins. The partition function for

194
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:12,870
indistinguishable particles is the sum over all of

195
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:18,700
those microstates I. Of the bowsman factor,

196
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:22,360
exponential to the negative energy of that micro

197
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:25,270
state divided by the temperature or multiplied by

198
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:31,120
the inverse temperature beta. And we argued and

199
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,770
there was a gap where you hopefully convince

200
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:37,660
yourself that every microstates of

201
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:40,180
indistinguishable particles in an ideal gas

202
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:45,440
corresponds to in factorial different microstates

203
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,970
of if those particles are distinguishable. And

204
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:52,210
that simply comes from taking all those particles

205
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:55,330
and slapping labels on each one and declaring a

206
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:58,630
different micro state for every permutation of

207
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:03,070
those labels, which provides that an vectorial

208
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:07,970
accounting factor. So. From that, we saw that the

209
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:11,060
partition function for distinguishable particles.

210
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:17,390
I was just in factorial.

211
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:26,740
Times that sum over the microstates the N

212
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:31,270
factorial is independent of the energy. So it's a

213
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:34,980
cost factor that can come outside the sum which

214
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:39,340
gives us that factorial times the

215
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:41,170
indistinguishable, partitioned function.

216
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:48,230
And going back to last week's work on the

217
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:51,560
canonical example, in general, we had the

218
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:57,190
revelation that the internal energy is the

219
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,750
negative. Derivative with respect to that internal

220
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:04,800
temperature of the logarithm of the partitioned

221
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:08,940
function. So if we consider here the partition

222
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:12,690
function for the distinguishable case, that means

223
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:16,110
that we're looking at the distinguishable internal

224
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:20,040
energy there. We have the

225
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:28,800
derivative with this constant factor of log and

226
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:33,390
factorial pulled out of that product.

227
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:41,230
Just using the usual properties of logarithms, the

228
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:47,500
derivative of this constant vanishes and we then

229
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,920
find. That

230
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:56,820
the internal energy in the distinguishable case is

231
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,980
identical to the internal energy in the

232
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:02,700
indistinguishable case, regardless of what the

233
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:06,540
particular form of those energies are in each

234
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:10,680
microstates. It only depends on whether this

235
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:14,130
different counting factor or whether really the

236
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:16,500
partition functions are directly proportional

237
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:23,040
to each other. Any constant factors multiplied by

238
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,010
multiplying the partition function will drop out

239
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:30,840
in the determination of the internal energy simply

240
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,400
because it's the.

241
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:38,740
Derivative of a logarithm, perhaps another way of

242
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:44,020
writing that or seeing it is to apply the

243
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:49,120
properties of derivatives of Florida rhythms that

244
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:57,610
it ends up with a one over Z D at DeVita. So in

245
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:01,690
the overall cost and factors in this Z in the

246
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:04,630
numerator and the one over Z that comes out from

247
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:07,410
the derivative of the log are going to cancel out.

248
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:12,490
And that is, you know, for professionals, that's a

249
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:18,100
very useful result and useful facts to to be aware

250
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:22,930
of that any causal factor is just drop out of the

251
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:25,990
internal energy because of factors in the

252
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:27,610
partition function, drop out of the internal

253
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:33,550
energy. And if we hop back to the case considered

254
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:40,000
last week in the canonical ensemble, we can see

255
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:46,060
why the simplification was not applicable. So this

256
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:49,870
here is the starting expression for the

257
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:54,040
indistinguishable partition function, in that case,

258
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:59,410
something over the energy levels. Here we have a

259
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,730
gas of spins that are indistinguishable rather

260
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:08,730
than. Particles with some kinetic energy and if we

261
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:09,480
want to.

262
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:13,540
Relate this.

263
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:18,610
Indistinguishable partition function to the

264
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:22,330
distinguishable case, we have to think about how

265
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:26,050
many different microstates there would be with

266
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:29,170
each of those energy levels if the spin's were

267
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:33,770
distinguishable. So just to consider some simple

268
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:38,420
cases in the case equals zero ground state with

269
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:42,290
the minimum energy, there's only a single

270
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:43,160
microstates.

271
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:47,740
Regardless of whether or not the spins are

272
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:51,220
distinguishable in here, I'm assuming that the

273
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:56,080
external magnetic field is oriented downward so

274
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,690
that all of those guys are parallel to it,

275
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:01,970
contributing negative energy. So there is

276
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:07,640
the same number of microstates in the

277
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:11,580
distinguishable and indistinguishable cases. So

278
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:16,080
there's a causal factor of one going up to the

279
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:17,550
first excited state.

280
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:28,250
We had. There's a comment that we had we might

281
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:32,600
have gone through this exercise already in the

282
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:36,560
notes that I'll wrap it up. Since it's.

283
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:43,250
Almost done here, if we can distinguish these

284
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:46,340
spins, you know, any one of the end can be

285
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:49,730
oriented opposite to that external magnetic field.

286
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:55,630
So there are and possible states and in full

287
00:31:55,650 --> 00:32:02,720
generality. We have this son of interviews, K

288
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:07,730
Times, these energy is better times, E.K., which

289
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:14,480
is minus and H plus to HK So the key here is that.

290
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,270
This.

291
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:26,660
Victor, I'm not sure why. This program is trying

292
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:29,990
to change the screen rather than just underlining

293
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:33,590
that factor, that counting factor going from

294
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:37,550
indistinguishable to distinguishable is

295
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:43,190
dependent. And there's no overall a constant

296
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:46,860
factor that can be pulled out to relate to

297
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,550
distinguishable and indistinguishable partition

298
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:53,180
functions. The thing to do is to rearrange all of

299
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:56,780
the terms of this finite sum to match up the

300
00:32:57,650 --> 00:32:59,900
distinguishable micro states with positive and

301
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:07,280
negative energies, which ends up producing. That.

302
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:13,200
Result that we saw earlier, that the distinction,

303
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,930
the case is the exponential of.

304
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:23,740
E to the minus beta age plus either the plus B to

305
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:27,730
age race to the power of N, which if we compare

306
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:33,750
that to. The full indistinguishable case is not

307
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,590
directly proportional to it, so that is the

308
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:42,360
explanation. Stated here is that counting factor

309
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:47,640
that varies with the energy and so rather than the

310
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:50,220
simple constants relating those to partition

311
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:52,290
functions we ended up with.

312
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:59,380
Non constant values that did not vanish in the

313
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:01,780
logarithmic derivative, providing the energy.

314
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:09,970
Pause for just a moment to see if any other

315
00:34:09,970 --> 00:34:11,830
questions have come in or if there are follow up

316
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:15,370
questions about that whole discussion, essentially.

317
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:23,870
Going through that background explanation and a

318
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:29,350
bit more detail and diving into the. Fundamental

319
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:32,200
reasons for this change in behavior.

320
00:34:55,370 --> 00:35:00,320
And not hearing any, I think, the remaining time.

321
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:04,570
Today, let's see fundamental reasons.

322
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:10,600
This is the I'm not sure if.

323
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:15,960
Your last comment in the chat window is a question

324
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:20,280
or just a comment? The fundamental reason for this

325
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:26,080
difference is the. The distinction, whether or not

326
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:28,010
the distinguishable and indistinguishable

327
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:31,070
partition functions are directly proportional to

328
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:34,340
each other, they are in the case of an ideal gas

329
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:38,690
and they are not in the case of a spin system. And

330
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:42,620
that is what goes through the calculation to

331
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:45,630
produce. That

332
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:51,390
net result, that different behavior in the two

333
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:52,050
energies.

334
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:03,270
So in the time remaining, I think we will be able

335
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:07,260
to do just one quick conceptual question and then

336
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:09,930
maybe a somewhat more detailed

337
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:16,050
computation, looking at the entropy for the ideal

338
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:19,890
gas, in particular, the mixing entropy that shows

339
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:25,290
up in this conversation or this section on the we

340
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:29,070
call it so-called gives paradox, which we saw is

341
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:31,710
not actually a paradox.

342
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:40,620
So switching over to. The whole here.

343
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:44,800
Just asking something that

344
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:50,730
doesn't necessarily need any formal computation,

345
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:52,120
it's more of an.

346
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:58,120
Developing an intuition for how information and

347
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:02,080
entropy are related. The question is, how do you

348
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:06,460
expect the entropy of an ideal gas to depend on

349
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:09,010
the distinguished ability of the particles in that

350
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:09,490
gas?

351
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:18,340
And more generally, this is even something that

352
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:20,170
could be considered.

353
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:28,420
For generic statistical systems, how would entropy

354
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:31,480
in general depend on the distinguished ability of

355
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,400
particles? What we can consider is just the ideal

356
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,170
use case for

357
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:41,800
to keep things more concrete and avoid having to

358
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,780
worry about whether we've captured all

359
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:44,740
possibilities.

360
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:57,040
I'll give you a minute or two to think about and

361
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:03,260
respond. To that, again, without a need for

362
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:04,820
detailed calculations.

363
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:13,340
But it's just instinct or intuition or.

364
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:21,810
And understanding the concept of how. And how

365
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:26,030
entropy and information are related.

366
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:35,450
And we do have multiple responses already that all

367
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:37,970
were in agreement about.

368
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:42,520
The.

369
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:51,980
The fact that the distinguishable particles, we

370
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:55,100
should expect a larger entropy and the conceptual

371
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:59,480
reason for this is that we can think of entropy as

372
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:02,780
to some extent a measure of the amount of

373
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:05,330
information in the system. And being able to

374
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:10,860
distinguish particles provides a. Provides more

375
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:13,500
information that we can extract from a given

376
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:19,530
system, and this is also visible in both the plots

377
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:22,140
that we had last week where

378
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:29,760
the distinguishable entropy was larger than the

379
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,980
indices in the case and also visible in this

380
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:36,330
equation. Fifty five here for the ideal gas,

381
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:41,970
specifically where all the leading behavior of the

382
00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:48,510
entropy is constant. The logarithmic correction in

383
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:51,720
the indistinguishable case is suppressed by this

384
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:55,590
factor of end, which is typically a large number.

385
00:40:57,630 --> 00:41:00,810
So now the more detailed question that will wrap

386
00:41:00,810 --> 00:41:08,500
up. Today's meeting is going back here to

387
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:12,460
get this up and.

388
00:41:15,090 --> 00:41:15,600
Running.

389
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:21,400
It has to do with the.

390
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:28,710
Calculation gone through on page 64 of the notes,

391
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:34,770
which is Nancy see, let me get to that, the

392
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:40,200
seventh page of the PDF, where we have two initial

393
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:43,260
systems, A and B, with the same number of

394
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:50,070
particles in the same size volume with a cell wall

395
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:52,980
separating those two volumes, A and B.

396
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:04,770
When we remove that wall, the particles in those

397
00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:08,670
two initial systems and B are allowed to mix in A

398
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:12,540
combined system C and then the wall is reinserted

399
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:19,260
and using gives his argument, we can assume that

400
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,270
to a good approximation, when that wall is

401
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:23,700
reinserted, there will be an equal or

402
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:26,700
approximately equal number of particles in each of

403
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:29,430
the two redivided systems.

404
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:39,540
A prime and be prime. And in the notes, without

405
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:42,810
too much in the way of gaffes for you to consider,

406
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:45,330
we went through the calculations in the case where

407
00:42:45,330 --> 00:42:48,450
all the particles were indistinguishable, in which

408
00:42:48,450 --> 00:42:49,170
case the.

409
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,000
Removing or reinserting the wall had no effect on

410
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,970
the entropy was constant from each of these stages

411
00:42:57,970 --> 00:43:00,580
to the next, and we also looked at the fully

412
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:03,700
distinguishable case where every particle could be

413
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:07,030
distinguished from all the others. In that case,

414
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:09,610
there was a mixing entropy that

415
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:14,500
was added to the system upon removing the wall,

416
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:17,620
and that persisted after that wall was reinserted

417
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:20,770
just because it was not possible to get all the

418
00:43:20,770 --> 00:43:23,890
way back to the initial states where the specific

419
00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:31,920
particles A.B.C. were all in. The same subsystem

420
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:35,160
where they had started off, so now the question

421
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:38,910
that is up in the

422
00:43:41,730 --> 00:43:44,910
polls everywhere is asking about an intermediate

423
00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:51,990
case where we suppose that the three particles or

424
00:43:51,990 --> 00:43:54,660
all of the particles in System A are

425
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:57,810
indistinguishable from each other, but they can be

426
00:43:57,810 --> 00:43:59,640
distinguished from the particles initially in

427
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:03,690
System B, maybe say one of these these particles

428
00:44:03,690 --> 00:44:08,430
are. In this case, red particles and systemis and

429
00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:10,950
green particles and System B.

430
00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:19,480
Or we could consider, say, oxygen consistency in

431
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:23,040
nitrogen molecules and System B that.

432
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:30,860
Are indistinguishable from each other. But

433
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:33,530
distinguishable from one set compared to that

434
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:39,320
other set, and the question is not looking at

435
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:41,600
reinserting the again, but just considering

436
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:44,510
removing the wall and combining these systems and

437
00:44:44,510 --> 00:44:51,530
B to form C, so let me zoom in on. That case, is

438
00:44:51,530 --> 00:44:58,350
there a. Mixing entropy in this intermediate

439
00:44:58,350 --> 00:44:59,150
situation.

440
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,950
And I'll remind you, in case you don't have it in

441
00:45:06,950 --> 00:45:08,390
front of you, that's the.

442
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:12,470
Two in law, two

443
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:17,960
mentioned in three of the possible responses, here

444
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:22,160
is the mixing entropy from the completely

445
00:45:22,190 --> 00:45:24,050
distinguishable case. So we had the full

446
00:45:24,050 --> 00:45:26,990
information about every single particle could

447
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:29,690
label each of them uniquely and distinguish each

448
00:45:29,690 --> 00:45:35,300
of them from the other. That's equation 58 on page

449
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:38,420
sixty six, page nine of that PDF. Just a couple of

450
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:42,080
pages further down from this picture we're looking

451
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:42,650
at here.

452
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:36,500
Let's say it looks like only one response has come

453
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:40,100
in so far in the interest of time, I may.

454
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:48,920
Started going through the calculation that you

455
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:52,850
would do to to answer this question, and that

456
00:47:52,850 --> 00:47:54,890
response is.

457
00:47:58,070 --> 00:48:01,570
Arguing that the mixing entropy from the system

458
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:07,040
where. The particles are indistinguishable within

459
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:09,590
each of the initial cell volumes would be greater

460
00:48:09,590 --> 00:48:12,770
than the mixing entropy of the fully

461
00:48:13,130 --> 00:48:15,830
distinguishable case. So let's go through the

462
00:48:15,830 --> 00:48:20,660
calculation and see how that comes out, where

463
00:48:21,290 --> 00:48:25,470
actually the entropy in the. Initial states, s.A

464
00:48:25,470 --> 00:48:33,600
plus SB. Turns out to be just the same as in the

465
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:37,740
Gap on the following page, considered here because

466
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:42,480
the particles are indistinguishable within each of

467
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:46,260
these cell volumes. So we just have twice the

468
00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:50,220
quintessential entropy for a system of particles

469
00:48:50,490 --> 00:48:56,190
in a volume V, which is written down up above

470
00:48:56,520 --> 00:49:02,550
three N plus two and times this logarithm of e.V.

471
00:49:02,790 --> 00:49:07,530
over in lambda cubed. That lambda is the thermal

472
00:49:07,530 --> 00:49:08,760
devilly wavelength.

473
00:49:11,470 --> 00:49:15,070
Defined above and now for the case of.

474
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:18,380
The combined system,

475
00:49:20,430 --> 00:49:21,510
what do we have?

476
00:49:25,030 --> 00:49:28,000
Well, we're out of time, so I will just tell you

477
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,880
that because the particles are not interacting

478
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:35,890
with each other, what we have is a system of in.

479
00:49:38,070 --> 00:49:43,320
Indistinguishable red particles that are now in a

480
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:44,250
doubled volume.

481
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:51,670
So there are none of those guys and there are also

482
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:55,120
an indistinguishable green particles in that same

483
00:49:55,130 --> 00:50:00,140
double volume, so. The change going from the

484
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:04,370
separate to the combined systems is in the volume

485
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:12,390
that the particles are. Able to occupy, which

486
00:50:12,390 --> 00:50:14,550
affects their energy levels and affects their

487
00:50:14,550 --> 00:50:17,960
entropies. Like so.

488
00:50:21,210 --> 00:50:25,530
And if we look at the difference between.

489
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:32,150
The combined and.

490
00:50:35,770 --> 00:50:41,140
Initially separated systems, well, the constant

491
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:44,830
factors of three and drop outs and all of the.

492
00:50:46,430 --> 00:50:48,380
Arguments of that law cancel out with the

493
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:52,160
corresponding arguments in there, and we are left

494
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:52,730
with

495
00:50:55,370 --> 00:51:00,140
two and more to two from that factor of two coming

496
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:03,320
from the volume. So the.

497
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:14,160
Response I would get is actually the same. Mixing

498
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:18,930
entropy for this sort of intermediate case, as for

499
00:51:19,350 --> 00:51:23,490
the fully distinguishable case that you went

500
00:51:23,490 --> 00:51:26,640
through in the notes here, which is

501
00:51:29,070 --> 00:51:31,460
something I might find a bit surprising.

502
00:51:34,210 --> 00:51:38,770
Just trying to work on conceptual intuition rather

503
00:51:38,770 --> 00:51:40,780
than going through the calculation, given that.

504
00:51:43,530 --> 00:51:45,930
You know, the partial distinguished ability

505
00:51:45,930 --> 00:51:49,080
provides only part of the full information is full

506
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:51,570
distinguished ability. Despite that, it still

507
00:51:51,570 --> 00:51:55,440
produces the same mixing entropy in the set up.

508
00:51:57,530 --> 00:52:00,480
And it may be fun to go through the calculation to

509
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:03,890
see what happens when the wall is reinserted. I'll

510
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:08,240
leave that for you and possibly put it on the.

511
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:11,820
Second homework assignment after the break. But

512
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:15,600
for now, I'll I'll stop talking there, see if you

513
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:20,280
have any final questions for today and come back

514
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:24,120
in a few minutes for office hours at the same zoo

515
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:26,880
meeting. I will shut down the meeting in order to

516
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:29,520
extract the recording and then restart it. I'll be

517
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,560
back here at the top of the hour.
