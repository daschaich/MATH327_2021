00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:05,490
Hello and welcome to the overview video for the

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:08,190
first week's content of the statistical physics

3
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:12,960
module, where the title for this week is Central

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,210
Limit Theorem and Diffusion. But that's really

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:20,340
encompassing all of the fundamental aspects of

6
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,200
probability theory that are going to form the

7
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:26,520
groundwork for everything we are looking at in

8
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,790
this term, really. And having said that, I should

9
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:33,060
say that once we go through this groundwork in

10
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:35,580
this week, it's going to be largely in the

11
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:39,450
background and we won't be doing exactly the the

12
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:45,060
sorts of work that that we'll be seeing in the

13
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:46,920
lecture notes in the synchronous sessions this

14
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,430
week. Considering formal definitions of

15
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:53,970
measurements and outcomes and probability spaces,

16
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:59,250
what we will be doing is building upon those

17
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:04,680
fundamentals a larger superstructure of of

18
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:11,730
applications that rely on these concepts of

19
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,400
experiments, measurements, outcomes and

20
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,030
probability spaces without explicitly giving those

21
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:21,420
a big role. So the flavor of this week is going to

22
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,150
be a bit different compared to those that are

23
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:28,290
coming up. And I'll see a bit more about that for

24
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,950
the moment. I'll just take a step backward to talk

25
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:35,880
about the the big picture overview of statistical

26
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,840
physics and this module more generally, which at

27
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,590
its essence is the is based on the application of

28
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,720
probability theory to

29
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:52,740
probabilistically predict physical phenomena, the

30
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,170
outcomes of experiments, whether those experiments

31
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:58,440
be things we actually do in a in a laboratory or

32
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,590
things we think about conducting experiments in

33
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:07,350
idealise systems, the the domain of statistical

34
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:11,370
physics. This application of probability theory to

35
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,700
predict properties of large scale systems grew out

36
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:18,030
of work in the in the late eighteen hundreds to

37
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,590
understand the empirically observed laws of

38
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:25,920
thermodynamics and how those could be understood

39
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,180
to emerge from the more fundamental behavior of

40
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,630
the atoms and molecules of which these large

41
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:39,150
systems of of gasses and fluids were built. And

42
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:42,150
this is obviously still relevant today because we

43
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:45,360
are still building systems out of atoms and

44
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,720
molecules and want to know how those large scale

45
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,590
systems behave without having to go through the

46
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:58,290
formal work of applying Newton's laws of mechanics

47
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:01,890
to all of the atoms and molecules that are in the

48
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:05,340
game, whether that be in the physics of neutron

49
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:09,750
stars, the physics of the atmosphere and climate

50
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,780
change, or the physics of internal combustion

51
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:17,820
engines or refrigerators, all of which rely on the

52
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:20,340
statistical physics that we will be seeing in this

53
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,760
module. And one of the remarkable things about

54
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:28,830
this whole domain of physics is the fantastic

55
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:33,810
accuracy with which this probabilistic analysis,

56
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:35,130
based in

57
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:40,680
the idea of random fluctuations, can really

58
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,700
predictably describe the large scale properties of

59
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:48,450
these systems, which, looking back historically,

60
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:52,890
this was a big puzzle in the eighteen hundreds and

61
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:55,650
there was a very long running debate even about

62
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:58,530
whether atoms and molecules, as we understand them

63
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,650
today, could be thought to exist at all. The

64
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:06,300
argument being that if we imagined systems like

65
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,500
the air being composed of a large number of

66
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,850
randomly jostling air molecules, why don't we

67
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:18,480
observe all of that random jostling when we work

68
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,150
with the air? Instead, we see behaviour that seems

69
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:24,240
to be very stable, very smooth. And the essential

70
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,010
answer at the qualitative and handwaving level is

71
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:31,320
that there are just so many molecules that their

72
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,500
effects all smooth each other out. And these

73
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,190
fluctuations are unobservable at the macroscopic

74
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:41,460
scale. We can easily observe and to quantify how

75
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:45,180
large is large. It's worth more worthwhile to keep

76
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,210
in mind Avogadro's number, which is about ten to

77
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:51,810
the power, twenty three, about a thousand billion

78
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:55,350
billion or ten thousand billion billion in round

79
00:04:55,350 --> 00:05:00,570
numbers. That is the number of watermill. He rules

80
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:04,920
that there are in 18 grams of water, which is not

81
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,710
very much. So we're talking about an enormous

82
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:13,230
number of degrees of freedom in the systems that

83
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:16,080
are governed by statistical physics, which also

84
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:21,390
helps us understand why we have the idea that

85
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:26,700
these are described by random fluctuations in

86
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:30,390
principle using the classical laws of Newtonian

87
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:32,370
mechanics from the sixteen hundreds we could

88
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:36,360
imagine track tracing of the positions and

89
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,870
momentum and interactions of all of those thousand

90
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:42,450
billion billion particles in a few drops of water

91
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:47,730
and predicting exactly how those particles and the

92
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:50,520
water as a whole is going to behave. That is

93
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,130
simply impossible in practice because there are

94
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:56,400
too many particles to many degrees of freedom to

95
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:01,440
keep track of. Instead, thanks to the law of large

96
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,360
numbers that we will see in the lecture notes for

97
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,180
this week, we can really

98
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:14,640
make the approximation that the behavior of all

99
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,310
those particles is just randomly fluctuating

100
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:23,490
around some collective average in this turns out

101
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:28,290
to give both accurate or both correct results that

102
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:32,880
are very precise and very accurate. And this is

103
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,140
perhaps remarkable, but we will take advantage of

104
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:41,460
it to learn about all sorts of different systems

105
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:44,160
throughout the course of this term. Again, relying

106
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,670
on this law of large numbers and the the related

107
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:52,050
central limit theorem that will put this

108
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:55,800
discussion on an actual mathematical basis rather

109
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,860
than the very qualitative handwaving overview that

110
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:02,070
I'm getting in this video. So just looking through

111
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:07,050
the few sections that the notes for this week are

112
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:10,170
split up into, the first section is looking at

113
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,620
some probability fundamentals, the concept of

114
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:17,880
experiments, measurement, outcome and probability

115
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:21,030
and how those are all interrelated and.

116
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,700
I will say, just keeping an eye on the big picture

117
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:30,420
and looking forward, the idea of experiment is

118
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:34,800
what underlies the so-called statistical ensembles,

119
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:38,670
that the module as a whole are organized around

120
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:41,490
things that are called the micro, canonical and

121
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:45,230
canonical ensemble and grand canonical ensemble,

122
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,890
all of which are based on the idea that an

123
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:52,920
experiment can consist of just getting a bunch of

124
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,530
degrees of freedom together, a bunch of molecules,

125
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:58,770
letting them evolve for some amount of time,

126
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,970
governed by Newton's laws, for example, and then

127
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,780
measuring the some aspect of the state of the

128
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:12,060
resulting system that that framework applied to

129
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:15,090
these probability fundamentals provides the

130
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:18,810
concept of ensemble that we will then use to

131
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:23,220
analyze ideal gases, quantum gases and all sorts

132
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:28,110
of of systems throughout this module right here.

133
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:31,290
We're going to be using these concepts of

134
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:37,260
probability and outcome to define some familiar,

135
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:40,620
quite hopefully familiar quantities like the mean

136
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:45,470
and standard deviation or variance of a

137
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:49,410
probability space, which leads to the law of large

138
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:53,760
numbers. The the fact that a empirical observed

139
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:57,240
arithmetic average over many repeated experiments

140
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:03,210
reproduces the theoretical mean that is predicted

141
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:06,390
by the probabilities themselves of the

142
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:10,320
mathematical level, as well as the central limit

143
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:17,190
theorem that governs the behavior of systems when

144
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:22,830
large numbers of particles are are all at play.

145
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:29,700
And we will use a few example applications to

146
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,490
illustrate aspects of the central limit theorem

147
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:38,370
and the the way in which repeated experiments can

148
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,790
provide that sort of smoothing or averaging out

149
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:46,590
process that leads to these very precise

150
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:53,120
mathematical approximations, even when the the

151
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,590
large and limit of the number of degrees of

152
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:59,280
freedom is not necessarily as large as 10 to the

153
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,070
power. Twenty three. So one of those examples is

154
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:05,040
looking at the game of roulette and thinking about

155
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,150
how much we or how likely we are to win or lose a

156
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:12,630
certain amount of money when playing a game of

157
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:17,040
roulette after some number of spins of the

158
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,060
roulette wheel. The second example being the case

159
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:27,060
of a random walker or an object that can move

160
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:31,440
randomly, which is a very versatile way of

161
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,120
modeling all sorts of physical phenomena. We'll be

162
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,510
looking at the very simplest case of a random

163
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:42,450
walker that can just take steps of a fixed length,

164
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,470
either to the right on a line or to the left on a

165
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:50,340
line, which, when

166
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,500
a sufficient number of those steps are taken, can

167
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,440
both be analyzed by the central limit theorem and

168
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:02,730
illustrates the process of diffusion and the law

169
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:07,890
of diffusion that turns out to be very general and

170
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:12,480
will be revisited in the computer project in a few

171
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,290
weeks where we will see how that law of diffusion

172
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:20,730
can break down, which is associated with the

173
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:23,910
applicability of the central limit theorem where

174
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,980
that comes from and what that produces. But for

175
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:30,000
now, let's start with the the basic fundamentals

176
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,980
of the probability central limit theorem and how

177
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:37,950
that is all related to the law of ordinary

178
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:41,130
diffusion in very general circumstances.
