00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:05,070
Hello and welcome back to a statistical physics.

2
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:08,960
This is the first video for week seven resuming

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,860
after the break. So let's start with a couple of

4
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:15,950
minutes. Just reviewing where we are in the module

5
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:20,000
and where we are going. As usual, with the aid of

6
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:26,950
taking a look at the written materials here. So in

7
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,870
approximately the first half of the module, we

8
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:34,730
have introduced the three core statistical

9
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:40,070
ensembles that form the bulk of of what we work

10
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:42,410
with in statistical physics, these being the micro

11
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:45,550
canonical ensemble, canonical ensemble and granth

12
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,770
canonical ensemble. And just as a quick reminder,

13
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:53,150
the micro canonical ensemble is defined by

14
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:56,870
conservation of energy and particle under the

15
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:59,690
canonical ensemble. No longer enforces

16
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:01,640
conservation of energy, but instead fixes a

17
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,400
temperature while keeping the particle no

18
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:07,730
conserved. And the grand canonical ensemble

19
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:10,040
doesn't conserve either energy or particle. No,

20
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,220
but instead fixes the temperature and chemical

21
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:19,780
potential. And just as we previously. Developed

22
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,650
and gained familiarity with the canonical ensemble

23
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:26,100
by applying it to investigate ideal gases and the

24
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,340
thermodynamic cycles, over the next few weeks, we

25
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:34,620
will gain familiarity and and expertise with the

26
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:37,740
grand canonical ensemble by applying it to

27
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,550
investigate quantum gases, which requires the

28
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:46,200
content of this week getting to grips with quantum

29
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,620
statistics. And what's quantum really means in

30
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:52,500
this context, with no assumption that you've seen

31
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,260
anything quantum before and no intention of really

32
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:59,610
teaching you about quantum mechanics, which is an

33
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:03,750
entirely different module in its own right. What

34
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:08,430
we're doing is taking some of the key features of

35
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,640
quantum physics and basically assuming those

36
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,000
adopting them as offsets or conjectures and seeing

37
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:20,070
what results when we apply our statistical toolkit

38
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:21,720
to the resulting systems.

39
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:27,670
There are still some conceptual subtleties here

40
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:31,600
that are the focus of this week, so you will see

41
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,850
that the materials are. Largely conceptual,

42
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:38,760
there's not much in the way of calculations and

43
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,990
and little exercises for you to work on and in in

44
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,000
the two videos that I have planned for this week,

45
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,720
I'll focus on what I think are the two trickiest

46
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:53,370
concepts here having to do with the contrast

47
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:56,760
between classical and quantum statistics, where if

48
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,200
you recall from way back in week for the ideal gas,

49
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:05,520
the word classical simply means not quantum and

50
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,470
anything. Quantum is not classical.

51
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,830
Now, the sort of obvious condition for quantum

52
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:17,370
physics is that the the system is quantized and in

53
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:20,910
particular the energies that we sum over and the

54
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:24,360
definition of either the canonical or grand

55
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,910
canonical partition function are those energies

56
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:30,330
are themselves quantized or discrete, falling into

57
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:33,960
energy levels of the sort that we saw back in week

58
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:38,400
three, four systems of spin's. But of course, back

59
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,130
in week three, even though we had these quantize

60
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:44,820
energy levels, we hadn't mentioned the concept of

61
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,830
of quantum physics and everything was still being

62
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:49,830
done classically. So there's a different change in

63
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:53,520
perspective that really distinguishes between

64
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:57,120
classical and quantum physics. And to give a

65
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,180
slightly different approach to that in this video

66
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:03,810
compared to the written material. Let me jump to

67
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:06,210
the statement of this difference at the end of

68
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:10,500
Section seven point one, and then go back and see

69
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:15,140
how this manifests in. In the earlier parts of the

70
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:18,860
section, so the difference between quantum and

71
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:21,770
classical statistics is that in the quantum case.

72
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:26,020
And we have to define this sum over the

73
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:30,070
microstates that gives us either the canonical or

74
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,320
in this case, the grand canonical partition

75
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,810
function and then all the properties of the system

76
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:38,800
from that in order to define the microstates in a

77
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,060
quantum system, we consider each possible discrete

78
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:46,600
energy level in turn and some over all of the

79
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,840
possible occupation numbers that this energy level

80
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,710
could have in. This contrasts with the quantum

81
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:58,450
approach where we consider each particle in the

82
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:01,540
system one by one and some over all of the

83
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:04,270
possible energies that that single particle could

84
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:04,750
have.

85
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,890
That classical approach is still applicable even

86
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:11,630
in the current canonical ensemble, where different

87
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:14,270
microstates have different particle numbers, just

88
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,970
some over all of the particles that there are.

89
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:21,290
What happens when we do so? We saw in week three,

90
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,280
we actually overcount the same micro state

91
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,190
multiple times when the particles are

92
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:30,740
indistinguishable, which they always are in the

93
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,540
context of quantum physics.

94
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:39,100
In that overcounting well, we corrected for it's

95
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,190
classically by.

96
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:49,380
Counting how many times the same system was

97
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,320
included, which turned out to be that factor of

98
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,780
one over and factorial and then just divide it

99
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,660
through by that one over. And Vectorial, a

100
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:03,330
normalization gave us the correct partition

101
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:06,510
function for indistinguishably articles with the

102
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:10,830
assumption that was hidden in a footnote, there

103
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:14,220
was the assumption that all of the particles were

104
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:19,170
in distinct energy levels in the case where the

105
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:24,490
energy level is defined by. The momentum and

106
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:27,430
retreat, the momentum is approximately continuous

107
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,510
numbers then.

108
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:33,780
It is essentially guaranteed that every particle

109
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,960
will have a a different momentum. There are

110
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:40,780
uncountable infinite numbers of possible momenta

111
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,730
and only a finite number of particles in the

112
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:47,580
universe. So there's a vanishingly small chance

113
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:50,700
that any of them have the same momentum. But when

114
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:55,810
the energy levels are. Discreet and quantize to

115
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:58,690
depending on how many energy levels are accessible

116
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:02,440
for the system, there may be a negligible chance

117
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:06,100
of having multiple particles, multiple identical

118
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:10,450
particles in the same energy level. And to show

119
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:15,040
what that does in this section, we go through a

120
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:19,240
simple little exercise of considering a canonical

121
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,540
system with a fixed number of two particles and

122
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:26,800
only five different energy levels, and we count

123
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,520
explicitly how many microstates there are to some

124
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:35,020
over and how many we would predict from the

125
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:38,830
classical argument we use in the past, refine

126
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:41,560
where you will find when you fill in this box a

127
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:47,570
nonsensical prediction. Whereas going over the

128
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:53,350
calculation more explicitly leads to. The

129
00:07:54,520 --> 00:08:00,810
exhaustive list here, which is not. A, not

130
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:05,040
something that can be obtained by counting all of

131
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,380
the microstates for the single particles and

132
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:11,490
dividing by any overcounting factor, we have to go

133
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:16,710
through energy level by energy level, count the

134
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,860
possible occupation numbers for each energy level,

135
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:24,120
and then that gives us the correct accounting of

136
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,600
all the microstates with no additional

137
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:31,250
overcounting factor that has to be included. So

138
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,590
I'll wrap up this video just with a further

139
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:38,650
comment on. What occupation numbers are possible

140
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:43,540
for typical physical systems, and it turns out for

141
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:47,050
somewhat technical reasons of quantum physics,

142
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:49,930
that there are two distinct classes of

143
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:53,830
possibilities that have the funny looking names of

144
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:57,850
those islands and fermions. Those names come from

145
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:01,960
being named after some 20th century physicists.

146
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,980
And really the fundamental distinction between

147
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:10,900
bosons and fermions is precisely the possible

148
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:17,290
occupation numbers for identical particles in a

149
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:22,420
given energy level. So bosons are somewhat

150
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:26,470
familiar or perhaps intuitive case where it is

151
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:29,080
possible to have any non-negative number of

152
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,710
particles in the same energy level.

153
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:37,090
And the particles that behave, this so-called

154
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:40,660
Bosnich statistics are photons, particles of light

155
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,220
and subatomic particles like pions, the Higgs

156
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:48,010
boson that was discovered almost a decade ago, as

157
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:53,610
well as many atoms, including helium for. The

158
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:57,750
other class of particles, there can be at most one

159
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:02,400
particle in any energy level. This is for fermions,

160
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:08,080
so. There cannot be multiple fermions in an energy

161
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,650
level, the energy level is either occupied by a

162
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:14,380
firm hand with occupation, number one, or it is

163
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:17,800
unoccupied. If occupation number zero, which is

164
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:23,410
behavior that was observed before quantum physics

165
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:27,060
was fully developed and became known as the the

166
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:31,660
exclusion principle, before the reasons behind it

167
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:32,620
were understood.

168
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:39,340
And the fact that only a single thermionic can

169
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:45,080
occupy any energy level is extremely important. It

170
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,800
is necessary for the existence of chemistry and

171
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,890
the existence of life, and it also gives rise to

172
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:54,250
very different quantum statistics compared to both

173
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:59,200
to to quantum bosons as well as to the classical

174
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,460
accounting that goes under the name of Maxwell

175
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:07,810
Walsman statistics and was reviewed in Section

176
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:11,990
seven point one. This long paragraph here is a

177
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:16,660
brief story, somewhat imprecise to explaining why

178
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:20,700
exactly those are the fermions differ in this way.

179
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:23,770
It does not have to do with any sort of direct

180
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:27,280
repulsion or pushing on each other in terms of how

181
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:31,780
many particles can occupy the same energy level.

182
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:36,890
It is a a more fundamental aspect of quantum

183
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:41,310
physics that you can skip if you are. Uninterested.

184
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:45,170
So in the next video, I'll briefly look at the

185
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:48,650
resulting statistics and then focus on the second

186
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,340
tricky conceptual issue, which is how do the

187
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:57,740
quantum and classical worlds reconnect, given the

188
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:01,010
knowledge that the classical physics were familiar

189
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:04,190
with from everyday experience is fundamentally

190
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:08,480
arising from quantum physics at a smaller distance

191
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,140
scales.
