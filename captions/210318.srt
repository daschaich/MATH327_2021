1
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:08,040
OK, I've got the recording underway and. It is

2
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:12,390
obviously a small crowd so far on this last

3
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:16,230
session before the term break in, that May.

4
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:22,120
Affects what we cover and how much detail we go

5
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:26,530
into have the usual first.

6
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,170
Question up and running for you to provide or

7
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:35,610
point out any. Point any places in the

8
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,370
asynchronous materials and he points that you want

9
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:41,190
to ask questions about, and this can also include

10
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,390
not just the notes on the grand canonical ensemble

11
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:50,820
for this week, but also the feedback and solutions

12
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,730
to the computer project. Now that you've had a few

13
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:57,270
days to to take a look at those. And speaking of

14
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:01,320
that computer project, the second part is now

15
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:06,020
online through the candidate site for the module.

16
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:12,000
It is due the second day after break, Tuesday the

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,840
13th of April. So while that's almost a month away,

18
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:20,100
three of those three and a half weeks are going to

19
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:26,010
be a term break. So you will benefit from getting

20
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:28,500
started on that part of the project over the break,

21
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:34,470
and I will keep. Office hours running during the

22
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:38,970
break at the usual zero lengths, including the one

23
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:41,610
that we're currently in. So those will be Mondays

24
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:46,350
at 10, Thursdays at two U.K. time. U.K. time is

25
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:50,280
also going to be shifting forward an hour in a

26
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,470
couple of weeks. So if you do get started with the

27
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:58,170
project over the break, have any questions about

28
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:01,020
the remainder of it, you will have those

29
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,930
opportunities to get in touch with me as well as

30
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:10,010
the asynchronous. Modes of communication through

31
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:13,730
the candidate site or through email.

32
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:21,250
And because this is the last session before the

33
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:25,030
break, I don't want to. Get started on anything

34
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:29,080
bigger involved, just make sure that we touch on

35
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:30,760
all of the.

36
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,350
Pieces that come in through the lecture notes for.

37
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,470
Week six on the grand canonical ensemble. And.

38
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:50,090
Given the small size, I think that whole

39
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:53,180
everywhere, maybe more trouble than it's worth

40
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:57,590
today, there are a couple of questions prepared,

41
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:04,690
but I think. It will be. Best for, you know, not

42
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:07,360
to run the polls and check in, but just sort of

43
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,300
discuss them in free form, you can feel free to

44
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:14,620
amuse yourself if you are able to type of the chat

45
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:19,810
window if you are not. And I'll just keep that one

46
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:24,160
open pole everywhere. Question for your requests

47
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,230
running throughout the.

48
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,870
The duration of this session, which may not even

49
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:34,050
last, the the full schedule time.

50
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:39,770
And I think we can get away with this in part

51
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:44,060
because this material from week six, setting up

52
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:48,140
the grand canonical ensemble is very much it's

53
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:51,020
very similar to a very much a parallel to the work

54
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:54,410
that we went through back in week three, moving

55
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:57,980
from the micro canonical ensemble to the canonical

56
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:03,150
ensemble. So just as a reminder, I imagine I said

57
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:06,240
this in the videos that go along with these notes,

58
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,990
but no harm in repeating myself that the

59
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:12,810
microeconomic ensemble was our starting point

60
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:15,810
because it very directly implements some

61
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:18,390
fundamental physical principles like conservation

62
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:22,200
of energy and conservation of article number. But

63
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:26,100
that means that it is inconvenient to work with in

64
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,700
experimental settings where energy is typically

65
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,550
flowing between the system being experimented on

66
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,410
and the individuals doing the experiments

67
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:41,880
themselves. And that motivated. Reformulating or

68
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:45,180
moving beyond the micro canonical formulation to a

69
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,670
different statistical ensemble, the canonical

70
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:51,120
ensemble where the particle number was still fixed

71
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,970
in the system, that that system was allowed to

72
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:57,900
exchange energy with its surroundings. And we. We.

73
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:04,500
Demanded that those surroundings were such that

74
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:08,610
the temperature of the system were kept fixed

75
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:13,290
whenever we apply to the canonical framework and

76
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:16,050
now in parallel to that, moving from a conserve

77
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:20,100
energy to a concert or to a fixed temperature, the

78
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,380
grand canonical ensemble removes that other

79
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:26,400
constraints conserve particle. No, and replaces

80
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:32,010
that with. Some other fixed quantity that is being

81
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,020
kept fixed by.

82
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,240
Connection with a large external reservoir where

83
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:48,030
now? If my screen wakes up. Now that external

84
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:51,730
reservoir exchanges both energy and particles with

85
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:57,410
the system. So going through the same.

86
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:03,310
Mathematical replica trick. Well, I should say we

87
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:05,230
define the chemical potential as the antidote to

88
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:10,110
the temperature that is being kept fixed and. With

89
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:12,840
that chemical potential new defined, we can go

90
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:18,970
through the same replica trick to put this. System

91
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:20,110
on a.

92
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:26,780
Solid mathematical foundation, and that involves.

93
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:30,980
Using our usual definition of thermodynamic

94
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:34,370
equilibrium as a state in which the entropy is

95
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:35,270
maximized.

96
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:38,150
To.

97
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:44,020
Determine the condition of thermodynamic

98
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:47,320
equilibrium subject now to three constraints, two

99
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:51,220
of which we saw before in week three, one of those

100
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,710
constraints is the usual one that probabilities

101
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:58,010
you have to add up to one. We demand that energy

102
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:00,590
is conserved in the overall universe that consists

103
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:03,680
of all of these replicas, and we now have to

104
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,320
demand also that the total number of particles in

105
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,660
the universe are similarly conserved.

106
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:18,010
So the. First question that was. Going to, he

107
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:18,580
asked.

108
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:25,280
In the sort of pull everywhere approach for this

109
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,550
week, there's going to be looking at this.

110
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:33,520
Constrained entropy maximization problem on page

111
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:39,220
86 and given the numbers, I think it's most

112
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:42,040
worthwhile just for me to talk that through

113
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,100
quickly and you can speak up if anything is

114
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:48,370
unclear or you can speak up if all of you already

115
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:50,260
have this worked out in front of you. And it would

116
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:53,890
be a waste of all our time to to consider it.

117
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,310
So feel free to interrupt, I'll just charge ahead

118
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:04,930
without waiting for any reactions, responses or

119
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:10,870
questions and just grind through the usual sort of

120
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:13,510
calculation that we have, which is taking a

121
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:19,920
derivative of this. Modified Essabar function,

122
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:24,600
which is both the usual entropy for this mini

123
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,450
replica system, along with the three constraints I

124
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:32,460
just summarized, where taking the derivative of

125
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:35,640
this, these sums over the occupation probabilities

126
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,480
peahi with respect to some piqué just picks out

127
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,170
Delta functions with Ion K and then.

128
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,950
Quickly gives us a.

129
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:56,880
Much simpler system.

130
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:02,090
A much simpler equation where.

131
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,590
The delts, the. You know, Delta function of I

132
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:15,290
think it picks up a lot of piqué, then we take the

133
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:17,420
derivative of the log, gives a one over P.

134
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:22,880
multiplied by IPE is one. Then there is just a

135
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,670
simple factor of Alpha with that Delta function,

136
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:29,270
that is some day over an hour. Time to speed up

137
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,110
with the energy coming from the Delta function.

138
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:39,390
And finally, this last. The fire. Gamma are the

139
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:44,150
particle number we are rearranging. Thing is to

140
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,470
isolate the.

141
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:51,210
Only place where the occupation probability now

142
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:58,300
shows up. We have. Four terms on the right hand

143
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:58,890
side.

144
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:06,330
And taking the exponential of both sides and

145
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:09,210
rearranging things slightly, we.

146
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,690
End up with.

147
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:22,030
A ratio of exponential. That's.

148
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,350
Puts things in the standard form for this

149
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:30,020
probability, one over now, a grand canonical

150
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:33,800
partition function and then a generalized

151
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:38,320
Boltzmann factor. And involves both the energy and

152
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:45,320
particle number of. The system and I realize now.

153
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:52,960
That I was going to actually skip ahead to look at

154
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:59,250
this entropy, now that's. We have. One of those.

155
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,980
Legrand's multipliers defined in terms of the

156
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:06,680
other two that created canonical partition

157
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:13,640
function. Is just the sum over microstates of that

158
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,190
exponential factor, the generalisable, some factor

159
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:20,440
into the minus beta at times energy plus Gamma

160
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:25,800
Times article number. And plugging that in to this

161
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,250
expression for the entropy on the bottom of page.

162
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,030
Six is.

163
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:41,290
Giving us. The following expression.

164
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:48,560
So I've kept one of these occupation probabilities

165
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,810
just hanging around with some.

166
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:56,600
Advance planning and plugging in the other

167
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:59,660
expression for the occupation probabilities one

168
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:04,970
over Z times, E to the minus beta energy plus

169
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:09,530
gamma particle. No, all we need to do is.

170
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:15,020
Distributes that's logarithm, the logarithm of a

171
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:20,240
product is the sum of the corresponding logarithms

172
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,630
of its terms. So that pulls out a.

173
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:31,610
Minus Log Z. And the minus signs cancels.

174
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:40,390
Star Log Z. Times that sum of probabilities. And

175
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:43,210
then the minus signs again, cancel from taking the

176
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:46,670
log of E to the minus beta energy. So it's beta

177
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:47,170
are.

178
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:55,590
And then. We have some of her I have those

179
00:12:55,590 --> 00:13:00,120
probabilities with a microstates dependence factor

180
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,550
of the energy that we can't pull out of the sun.

181
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:05,640
And similarly for.

182
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:12,580
The last term now with a different sign and a sum

183
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:17,120
over the particle numbers rather than the micro

184
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,960
state entities, and you can recall the

185
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:23,080
probabilities over all microstates sum up to one

186
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:28,330
and the other. Some defined the usual expectation

187
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:34,120
values, so this all boils down to a beat. Times

188
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,200
are times.

189
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:44,070
The. Expectation value with this factor of, ah, we

190
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:49,140
can recognize I'm taking this ah. To the right

191
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:54,690
hand side and. Looking in occupation probability

192
00:13:54,690 --> 00:14:01,150
in place of the olsun factor and. When partition

193
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:08,240
function. Oops. And slide back down and pick out.

194
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,640
That total energy was a factor of Beita in the

195
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,670
total particle number with the factor of Gamma.

196
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,100
And again, any questions, as we just talked

197
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:28,990
through some of these aspects of the derivation,

198
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,990
feel free to. Unu taught us to toss them in the

199
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:35,870
chat or toss them in everywhere, and I'll flip

200
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:38,570
back and forth between various screens to try to

201
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:45,820
keep an eye on things and. The key developments

202
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:50,290
with this replica trick, just as it was for the

203
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:54,850
canonical ensemble, was that we are able to

204
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:58,060
determine these Legrange multipliers purely in

205
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:01,780
terms of that temperature and chemical potential.

206
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:07,640
That are fixed for our small system with no or for

207
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,470
a grand canonical system with no reference to the

208
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:13,620
much larger external particle reservoir that it is

209
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:14,610
in contact with.

210
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:21,100
In this lets us express every aspect of our great

211
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,410
canonical system simply in terms of its

212
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:28,980
temperature and chemical potential. Which brings

213
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:32,250
us. To during this

214
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:39,840
similar sort of calculation. Now, toward the end

215
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:46,200
of the notes for the week on page 90, we played

216
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,930
this where we do the similar.

217
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,190
Calculation of.

218
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:58,160
Plugging in the.

219
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:06,050
Micro state probability is now high in terms of.

220
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,210
The temperature and chemical potential rather than

221
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:16,770
the mid-range multiplier gamma, it's the sun there

222
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,050
is for a single micro state, I you have the

223
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:24,220
exponential of the inverse temperature times, the

224
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:28,380
energy. Plus, the chemical potential over that

225
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:32,310
temperature in the particle number so that

226
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:37,000
expanding the logarithm of that probability. It

227
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,800
was just that same grand chemical partition

228
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:44,580
function. Better times, the energy and of you.

229
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:50,140
Times the particle number, which, again, something

230
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:52,750
over all the microstates with the corresponding

231
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:58,140
probabilities defines the expectation. Values.

232
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:06,420
Better times the average expectation value for the

233
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:12,150
internal energy and. Beat a few times.

234
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,350
The expectation value for the particle number,

235
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:20,040
which you can recognize, is.

236
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:27,400
The accommodation that. Had just been computed,

237
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:30,250
the derivative of the grand potential, the

238
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:33,400
analogue of the Helmholtz, free energy with

239
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,170
respect to the temperature.

240
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:49,300
And know that a few more people have joined in,

241
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:53,640
I'm wondering whether or not. It's worth.

242
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:57,500
Trying to do a whole.

243
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,320
Maybe we'll try it. See how it goes just to check

244
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,400
in. So that was the equilibrium entropy on page

245
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,450
eighty six we just discussed. The.

246
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:18,990
Corresponding derivative of that creative

247
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:24,210
potential with respect to. The chemical potential

248
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:27,780
now, instead of the temperature maybe worth taking

249
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:31,030
a look at, and that is on the previous page here.

250
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:31,830
Eighty nine.

251
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:39,490
Where? This. Grant medical potential itself, the

252
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:42,070
definition does not quite fit on the same screen.

253
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:48,970
And while that poll is up and running for. You to

254
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:49,840
interact with,

255
00:18:52,330 --> 00:19:00,670
I can quickly copy over the. Definition that we

256
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:06,960
have this fight is. Negative temperature at times.

257
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:11,220
The longer the grand economical partition function.

258
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:19,800
We're. The legal petition function is something

259
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,270
over all the microstates.

260
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:24,760
With this.

261
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:30,460
Combined factor of energy and particle number,

262
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:34,990
chemical potential, having dimensions of energy to

263
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,950
get everything consistent in. Exponential function.

264
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:33,900
Responses are coming in and there's already a good

265
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:39,340
fractioned response who have responded so. I won't

266
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:44,540
wait another minute or less before. Moving on.

267
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:34,930
And taking a look at your responses, if the.

268
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:39,420
Screen wakes up here, they are evenly split.

269
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:45,560
Between options B and D, so going through this

270
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,290
myself, I would plug in.

271
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:55,280
Pull out that overall factor of the temperature,

272
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,180
which is not.

273
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:03,860
Affected by the. Derivative with the with respect

274
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:06,110
to the chemical potential, and then.

275
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:14,340
The derivative of the logarithm, you remember, and

276
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:17,510
let me convert this into a bit of the inverse

277
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:22,430
temperature that I. Used in the. Statement of the

278
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:25,430
problem to set us off here, the derivative of a

279
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:34,400
log is one over Z times. You acting on Z, which is.

280
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:43,860
The sun. Over this. Generalised exponential factor.

281
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:49,860
Where the chemical potential Mbewe appears in only

282
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:50,700
one place.

283
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:54,530
I'll just circle here in the same colors,

284
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:57,530
hopefully leaving things still legible, so taking

285
00:22:57,530 --> 00:23:01,190
the derivative of the exponential brings down a

286
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:06,050
factor of plus Beta and I. So we have a beta over

287
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:13,960
beta, whatever zg then a sum over I of that in I.

288
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:18,720
In the exponential. Persists.

289
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,420
And we can recognize the one over Z in the.

290
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:30,970
Exponentially weighted probabilities as

291
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,790
probabilities that are defining the.

292
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:45,200
The defining the expectation value over in and I

293
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,760
paused because I noticed that I forgot to. Retain

294
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,910
the negative sign from the previous line, so we

295
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:56,050
have a negative one times that expectation value

296
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:02,670
of an. Which was an option D in the poll.

297
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:07,660
And.

298
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,150
Because.

299
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:17,380
This development of the the grand canonical

300
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,460
ensemble is.

301
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,820
So closely aligned with the.

302
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:27,790
Earlier development of the canonical ensemble we

303
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:32,500
end up with. Final results that look very similar,

304
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:37,940
the entropy in terms of the derivative of. This.

305
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:43,740
Minus two times the lord of the partition function

306
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:50,440
and similarly the. Internal energy is. Related to

307
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:53,650
the derivative of just the log itself, canceling

308
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:58,610
out that overall factor of the temperature. And.

309
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:09,980
In addition to letting us generalize that first

310
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:14,120
law of thermodynamics to a generalized

311
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:19,190
thermodynamic relation. The.

312
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:26,000
The one last thing and I want to to bring up today

313
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,710
before. This module goes on its break

314
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:37,690
would be to. Actually dig a little bit deeper into

315
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:44,440
the connection between. The grand canonical

316
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:48,340
ensemble and the canonical ensemble in the form of

317
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:54,300
the corresponding partition functions, and I made

318
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:58,360
it a bit of blank space for this, which we have

319
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:58,810
here.

320
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:08,030
What I.

321
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:14,800
Points out zooming in. Slightly.

322
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:24,150
Is if I write grand canonical partition function

323
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:27,270
and noting that it is this function of temperature

324
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:30,990
and chemical potential that we saw was the sum of

325
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:35,780
all the microstates of each of the minus beta. I

326
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:40,510
was the energy of the microstates. Plus, beta, the

327
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:43,870
inverse temperature times, the chemical potential

328
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:46,810
times, the number of particles in that microstates

329
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:51,040
and just using the properties of an exponential

330
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:57,940
function, you can break. That's. Single factor

331
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:02,530
into two factors and even two factors, one of

332
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:05,380
which is raised to a power exponentially raised to

333
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:08,560
a power, just multiply the existing argument of

334
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:12,790
the exponential and then that of the minus Beta

335
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:17,040
Etai. That is familiar from the canonical example

336
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:21,990
is still coming along for the ride. And if we do

337
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:26,640
the usual trick of supposing we have a finite

338
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:31,890
number of microstates in freely rearranging the

339
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:35,370
terms of the sun, we can break up the overall sum

340
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:41,430
into all of the microstates into actually a sum of

341
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:47,100
sums that depend on the particle number in the

342
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,890
corresponding microstates. So picking out all of

343
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:53,070
the microstates where there are zero particles.

344
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,560
We were just have, you know, an exponential factor

345
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:00,890
raised to the power of zero is unity, so only the

346
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:03,980
E to the minus in temperature times, energy,

347
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:07,820
things around and doing the same when there is a

348
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:14,330
single particle. The single factor of the chemical

349
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:17,990
potential over temperature is the same.

350
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:23,520
Eat of minus energy over temperature.

351
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:26,960
And then.

352
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,380
We have two particles that factor gets squared.

353
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:41,020
The Boltzmann factor is the same as always and so

354
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:44,560
on off to however many particles we may have.

355
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:50,010
And we can do two things with the equation in this

356
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:54,660
form, the first one is can define a shorthand.

357
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:58,980
This letter, Zeda, is.

358
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:05,280
This combination e to the chemical potential over

359
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:05,970
temperature.

360
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:14,690
Which is known historically as the three Cassity.

361
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:20,650
This parameter Zeta, and we can recognize that.

362
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:26,960
Each of these songs that we've written here.

363
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:34,630
The specter of the sagacity is just a concept that

364
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:36,460
does not depend on the micro state and can be

365
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:39,400
pulled out in front of the sun. And what is left

366
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:43,090
in the sun over microstates is then just the.

367
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:50,100
Canonical partition function for a fixed number of

368
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:55,150
particles where I will write. That canonical

369
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:58,690
partition function as a Z with no subscripts, with

370
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:01,900
arguments of temperature and particle, no a

371
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:02,770
capital N..

372
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:08,290
Maybe I'll even make that a lower case and so it's

373
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:11,140
not confused with any of the particles in each

374
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:14,080
microstates, so this sum here is over all of the

375
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:18,460
microstates with zero particles. So that is just

376
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:21,280
the canonical partition function at the same

377
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:25,420
temperature. We had to begin with with zero

378
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:29,830
particles, and then we can add a factor of the

379
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:34,040
sagacity by. Least favorite Greek letter to write.

380
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:39,190
The canonical partition function with a single

381
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:42,870
particle. Plus, the gas, the squared.

382
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:50,360
The two particle canonical partition function and

383
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,950
so on and in general.

384
00:30:55,920 --> 00:31:00,150
Writing this as a sum over the total number of

385
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:05,660
particles in canonical systems. Starting from zero,

386
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:08,880
and we can take the limit now off to infinity that

387
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:12,590
we've rearranged things healthily with a finite

388
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:16,130
number of microstates, if we Kassidy to the power

389
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:18,650
of the number of particles and the economical

390
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:21,680
competition function at our fixed temperature and

391
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:25,190
fixed particle number rather than fixed chemical

392
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:25,820
potential.

393
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:33,940
So this is a direct relation between. The grand

394
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:37,570
canonical partition function as an infinite sum

395
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:41,380
over canonical partition functions for all

396
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:45,910
possible numbers of particles showing the

397
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:49,900
connection between the canonical and grand

398
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:57,350
canonical formulation in. This is known as the

399
00:31:57,350 --> 00:32:00,200
focus of the expansion, you may see it

400
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,370
referred to in those terms in.

401
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:10,340
In the resources, in Wikipedia, possibly in a in

402
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:13,550
the next homework assignment, depending on whether

403
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:16,220
this seems interesting enough to to dig into.

404
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,450
And really, just to. Wrap up by.

405
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:29,390
Demonstrating why this sort of perspective can be

406
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:36,500
useful if we see those are the six notes we have

407
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:42,430
here, if we hop back to. The lecture notes for

408
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:45,920
week for. When we started off.

409
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:52,190
Investigating the canonical partition function for

410
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:56,690
an ideal gas, we began by computing.

411
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:03,760
The partition function just for a single particle

412
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:09,280
of a gas in some volume v., which fixed the

413
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:12,760
possible moment. It could have and gave us the

414
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:18,430
form of the mini particle or the end particle

415
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:23,050
partition function in terms of the single particle

416
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:27,340
partition function that someone to the power in.

417
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:32,270
Where in terms of this. Thermal generally

418
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:34,880
wavelength, that single particle partition

419
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:39,650
function was just that total volume over.

420
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:46,590
Thirroul. Wavelength cubed.

421
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:52,930
Something. Even more interesting happens if we

422
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,080
consider the case of indistinguishable particles

423
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,130
where.

424
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:02,720
We saw that the. Distinguishable and

425
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,970
indistinguishable partition functions were just

426
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:08,060
related by this accounting factor, one over and

427
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:10,640
factorial, so long as we can assume that all of

428
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:15,320
these in particles have different energies where

429
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:19,980
that ratio of volume to. Definitely, wavelength

430
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:23,310
cubed is the single particle partition function.

431
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:28,860
And if we hop back now to the Grand Canal context

432
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:32,160
and we want to consider an ideal gas where the

433
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,890
particle number can change, we just have an open

434
00:34:34,890 --> 00:34:38,700
container of gas where the gas particles are able

435
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:42,930
to wander in and out of the the topic for the open

436
00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:48,920
sides of this unsealed container at will. Then.

437
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:57,290
It's looking in. That indistinguishable partition

438
00:34:57,290 --> 00:35:02,260
function in terms of the single particle partition

439
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:03,440
functions and one.

440
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:10,960
You can immediately. Right down the grand little

441
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:16,590
partition function in terms of. It's the bottom of

442
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:20,280
the page in terms of the temperature and chemical

443
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:24,970
potential or. You can change variables to use

444
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:29,410
sagacity in place of that chemical potential, just

445
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:34,390
as some. Over all possible particle numbers.

446
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:40,200
Of the ferocity to the power and whatever and

447
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:44,450
Vectorial and said one to the power and or

448
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:49,210
rearranging things. Slightly. Whatever in

449
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:53,670
Vectorial Times, sagacity, time, single particle

450
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:58,560
partition function to the power end, which is the

451
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:03,840
serious expansion for the exponential function put

452
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,680
back in now.

453
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:10,900
The capacity in terms of the chemical potential

454
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:14,410
and temperature, so we get a very compact

455
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:18,770
expression for. The grand canonical position

456
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:22,040
function of a night of not an ideal gas is

457
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:26,120
indistinguishable particles should make a note of

458
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:26,450
that.

459
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:32,870
In terms of this single particle partition

460
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:39,940
function that we. Saw before was just the ratio of

461
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:44,050
the volume to the wavelength cubed. I can plug

462
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:45,580
that in here and now.

463
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:51,340
And that comes immediately from this connection

464
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:56,740
between canonical and grand canonical formulations

465
00:36:56,740 --> 00:37:00,860
through the focus, the expansion and. This.

466
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:07,670
Exponential of an exponential is a fun feature

467
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:10,460
that often pops up in in the great economical

468
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:15,380
partition function, just indicating the sort of

469
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:22,000
scale of multiplicities or. Or systems that we are

470
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:22,930
working with here.

471
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:28,790
When not only can the number of particles often be.

472
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:35,190
Enormously large, like a factor of. And the power

473
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,740
twenty three, but were then taking exponential of

474
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:42,640
those sorts of power, 23 factors with exponential

475
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,460
functions inside the arguments of other

476
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:48,730
exponential functions, things get very large very

477
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:54,140
quickly in statistical physics. And that is. But

478
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:55,740
we will see in more detail with.

479
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:03,390
New applications of the grand canonical ensemble

480
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:07,230
after the term brake applied to quantum statistics.

481
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:14,230
We'll need to spend a little time introducing. The

482
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:17,650
new wrinkle of quantum statistics, which shows up

483
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:22,130
in the assumption I mentioned. Back in week four,

484
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:24,820
where we assume that all the particles occupied

485
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:28,160
different energy levels, if we discard that

486
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,440
assumption, things will turn out a bit differently.

487
00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:35,420
And a bit more interesting ways that allow us to

488
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:38,630
connect with experimental observations, but this

489
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:45,560
is. All that I think there was to go through with

490
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:48,710
the asynchronous materials we have up to the break.

491
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:52,720
I will stop there, invite you again to ask

492
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:57,370
questions, and I'll be back in this room in about

493
00:38:57,370 --> 00:39:02,050
15 minutes for office, hours after I've shut down,

494
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:05,470
Zuman extracted this recording. So any questions

495
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:10,150
about anything we have seen or done in the past

496
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:10,810
six weeks?

497
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:21,220
And if not, you can feel free to. Head off and

498
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:24,850
start enjoying your break, at least from this

499
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:25,360
launch of.
