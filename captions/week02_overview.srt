00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,680
Hello and welcome back to week two of the

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:07,790
statistical physics module, math 327.

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,610
This is the overview video for the week, which

4
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:14,730
will aim to serve as an introduction to the

5
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:19,560
lecture notes, doing two things in approximately

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,580
the next ten minutes. So first goal of this video

7
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:28,530
is to orient this week in the overall scope of the

8
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:32,010
module across the entire term, seeing how it

9
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:35,130
builds on what we went through the previous week,

10
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:38,400
week one, and then how it's going to be built on

11
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,400
in turn as we go on and develop things further in

12
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:45,000
the coming weeks. And after looking at that very

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,300
big picture very abstractly, we'll focus in on

14
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:55,230
some of the main topics in the lecture notes for

15
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,110
this week for you to keep an eye out for as you

16
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,380
read through those. And then we will come back

17
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:04,710
around to them and just summarize the takeaway

18
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:08,550
points in the separate video after you've gone

19
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:12,390
through those notes. So looking at the big picture,

20
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,470
there's going to be what feels like a significant

21
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:19,890
change in style or focus this week compared to

22
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:23,670
last week. So last week we were focusing on the

23
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:26,250
essentials, the essential foundations from

24
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,850
probability theory. And this week we are going to

25
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:33,930
start applying those to statistical physics and in

26
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:39,780
particular, statistical ensembles. So this week is

27
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:44,460
going to be sort of the model for much of the rest

28
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,550
of the term. We will be looking at three different

29
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:51,540
types of statistical ensembles, all of which have

30
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,200
a few basic things in common. First of all, they

31
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,480
are grounded or they are based on the probability

32
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:04,080
foundation that we established last week. But now

33
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:09,060
that we are focusing on developing these ensembles

34
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,740
as a no more higher level framework and applying

35
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:17,970
that framework to interesting systems and

36
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:21,570
phenomena, that probability theory is going to

37
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:23,400
fade into the background a bit. We'll know it's

38
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,740
there providing the foundation for the work we're

39
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:29,820
doing, but we will mostly be focused on exploring

40
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,550
and applying the frameworks that are built on top

41
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:37,410
of those foundations. And as I said, that's this

42
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:39,390
is this week is the first example of one of those

43
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:42,390
frameworks in the form of the micro canonical

44
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:45,000
ensemble, which I probably should have mentioned

45
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,780
earlier, as it is the title of the week. The other

46
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,720
two ensembles we will be looking at in later weeks

47
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,150
are called the Canonical Ensemble and Grant

48
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:58,440
Canonical Ensemble, and all three based on the

49
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,710
same probability foundations and also all three

50
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:06,990
based on the same qualitative idea that these are

51
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:09,780
mathematical frameworks. Each of these ensembles

52
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,990
is a mathematical framework or specifically a

53
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:17,280
probability space that is designed to describe the

54
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,060
behaviour of systems that involve large numbers of

55
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:24,360
particles where all use particles interchangeably

56
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,990
for degrees of freedom. A bit more formal term. We

57
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:30,270
have large numbers of particles that are evolving

58
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:35,890
in time, subject to certain constraints. And in

59
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:38,550
each of those three cases, micro, canonical,

60
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:42,450
canonical and grand canonical, the detailed form

61
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:44,460
of the constraints will be different, reflecting

62
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:47,850
different physical situations in the micro

63
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:51,180
canonical ensemble. What we have in mind is a

64
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:55,350
system that is completely isolated from the rest

65
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:59,040
of the universe. It has some number of particles

66
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,970
that have some amount of energy and because it is

67
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:06,210
isolated, it can exchange neither particles nor

68
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:10,980
energy with its surroundings or with anything else

69
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:14,850
in the universe. So both particle number and

70
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:18,420
energy are conserved quantities for this system

71
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:21,900
and that conservation of energy

72
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:29,370
is hopefully a familiar concept. It was to some

73
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:31,860
extent developed by considering the source of

74
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:35,640
statistical systems. So in this context,

75
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,730
conservation of energy in an isolated system is

76
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:42,450
given a rather grand, grand or grandiose sounding

77
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:45,930
name. The first law of thermodynamics, which is

78
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,940
one of the things being seen this week, along with

79
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:54,170
the second law that will come to in just a bit.

80
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:55,560
Now,

81
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:02,080
one key both. For the MicroCon article ensemble,

82
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,120
as well as all the others, so this is a third

83
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,300
thing that all three have in common in addition to

84
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:10,000
their probability foundation and their

85
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,140
interpretation as physical systems evolving in

86
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:17,800
time, in addition to both of those, we are only

87
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,130
going to be considering these ensembles in what is

88
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:26,140
called thermodynamic equilibrium. And you will see

89
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:28,870
a detailed discussion of thermodynamic equilibrium

90
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:32,950
in the notes, along with two definitions of this

91
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:35,710
concept that are equivalent for the micro

92
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:40,090
canonical ensemble. The big idea is that we are

93
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:43,150
looking at systems that, as they evolve in time,

94
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:47,830
are fairly stable, fairly steady, like the air in

95
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:51,310
this room. There are no wild changes just

96
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:55,240
happening spontaneously with no outside influence.

97
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:59,530
We don't have all the air rushing over to that

98
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:03,280
corner to my right or that corner to my left. At

99
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,350
any point, it's all feels very smooth and and

100
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,680
steady over time. Of course, that's this is the

101
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,080
overview video. This is all the qualitative

102
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:19,000
literally handwaving idea that is then more

103
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,760
carefully defined mathematically and elaborated on

104
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:28,390
in the in the lecture notes and based on the micro

105
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:31,570
canonical ensemble in thermodynamic equilibrium.

106
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:36,640
We will after defining that concept mathematically,

107
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,780
we will use it to introduce two important derived

108
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:44,500
quantities, at least one of which I'm sure you've

109
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:48,640
heard of. These are first, the entropy and then

110
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:52,960
the temperature. And again, without going into

111
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,700
details in this big overview, the fact that both

112
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:01,240
of these are derived quantities might be

113
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:04,720
surprising if you are used to thinking of the

114
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,250
temperature as a sort of intrinsic property of

115
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:12,640
some system. So I have in this coffee cup, there

116
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:17,230
are say ten of the twenty five molecules. And I

117
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:20,050
can sort of feel that at this point I've been

118
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:22,840
talking too long and they're relatively cold. The

119
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:26,290
temperature is a very intuitive thing I'm able to

120
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,020
pick up on from here. In the micro canonical

121
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:31,510
ensemble, we're thinking of systems that are

122
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:34,360
completely isolated from the environment. So those

123
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,430
differ from this coffee cup. I can't just look in

124
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,520
feel and say, oh, it's got a unfortunately cold

125
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,210
temperature. We have to define the temperature as

126
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:47,950
some mathematical function of the more fundamental

127
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,680
quantities that define the ensemble, specifically

128
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:55,180
its energy and its number of particles, number of

129
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:58,990
degrees of freedom, or more generally, the number

130
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:03,730
of states that the system can realize based on

131
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:06,880
those two defining features, the number of degrees

132
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,930
of freedom and the amount of energy. And I'll call

133
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:14,680
the individual states that the system can realize

134
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,990
those will go by the term microstates going

135
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:23,680
forward because they are descriptions of the whole

136
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,230
set of microscopic degrees of freedom in the

137
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:31,270
system. And based on all of those microstates, we

138
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:36,010
define these derived quantities of temperature and

139
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:38,470
entropy, entropy. I suspect

140
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,940
many of you have also heard of, though it's a more

141
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,970
specialised concept that we intuitively think of

142
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:50,500
measuring the amount of disorder in a system and

143
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:54,190
we will see mathematically what that amounts to in

144
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:58,270
the definition of temperature sorry, the

145
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:02,320
definition of entropy. See how this concept

146
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:07,240
matches on to the number of available states or

147
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,340
the number of available available microstates. I

148
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,760
should be careful to use the terms of define. And

149
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:19,210
I also want to highlight the example that we will

150
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,450
be using throughout this week to illustrate all of

151
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,750
these both fundamental concepts and derived

152
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:29,440
quantities. We will be looking at a system of

153
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,660
particles where the particles can only take one of

154
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:40,510
two orientations. They can be so they can be sort

155
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:44,110
of pointing up or pointing down is the usual

156
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:48,730
picture. And we have the terminology that we use

157
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:52,660
for this is that these particles are a spin. Each

158
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:55,150
particle is a spin that can have one of two

159
00:09:55,150 --> 00:10:02,480
orientations up or down and. This is to some

160
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,990
extent an artificial example, because it's very

161
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:09,800
much an oversimplification compared to the sorts

162
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,900
of systems we will be interested in later on in

163
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:15,560
the term the air moving in the room or the coffee

164
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,770
moving around in my cup. The benefit of spin

165
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:20,960
systems is that the mathematics is extremely

166
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,740
simple because there are only two possibilities.

167
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,930
The mathematics is essentially the same as that of

168
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:31,370
flipping a coin. And we talked about last week and

169
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:34,310
at the same time, despite being so simple, it's

170
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:38,000
not a terrible approximation for several physical

171
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,890
systems, particularly magnetic systems, magnetic

172
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:48,740
molecules or systems of the underlying physics of

173
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:53,180
Ferrol. Magnets can be modeled as simply spins

174
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:56,930
that are either pointing up aligned with a

175
00:10:56,930 --> 00:11:00,470
magnetic field or pointing down aligned against a

176
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:03,440
external magnetic field. That external magnetic

177
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,940
field introduces a temperature sorry. It

178
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:10,850
introduces an energy for these spins, and that

179
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:13,460
