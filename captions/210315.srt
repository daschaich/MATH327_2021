1
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:08,760
Well, the recording should now be underway and may

2
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:12,480
get a few more people coming by in the next few

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,710
minutes, we are in that last week before the break

4
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:23,880
that deal with some related logistical stuff while

5
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:29,580
waiting for more folks to trickle in. I guess the

6
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,820
obvious thing is that the first more traditional

7
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,670
homework assignment is due at the end of the day

8
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:41,100
tomorrow. A couple of questions have come in about

9
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,230
it since our last meeting on Thursday. In a couple

10
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:47,790
of the answers to those questions are.

11
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,110
Discussed in the discussion forum on the canvass

12
00:00:56,110 --> 00:01:01,870
site for this molecule under the hole works one.

13
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:04,460
Discussion.

14
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:10,370
Mostly dealing with clarifications of what

15
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:17,210
assumptions need to be made or. How far to push

16
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:22,670
things like simplifying certain results and you're

17
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:29,320
welcome to bring in. More questions about that,

18
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:33,370
either through Paul everywhere or just directly

19
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:35,800
through zoom in the chat window or on muting

20
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,420
yourself.

21
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:46,490
And at the same time. The feedback and solutions

22
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:50,630
for the first part of the computer project were.

23
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:58,290
Distributed overnight. And it may be too early in

24
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:02,280
the morning in Liverpool for most of you to have

25
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:06,330
follow up questions to ask about that, the

26
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:12,890
solutions themselves. I also put we're also linked

27
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:18,470
through the discussion forum in Dorthe, the PDF

28
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:21,140
and corresponding Python code

29
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:32,620
and going through. Well, as a brief, the generic

30
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:35,500
feedback on the overall assignment, I can say that

31
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:40,990
there were not too much too many problems, not too

32
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:44,410
much difficulty encountered with the the first

33
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,060
couple of exercises that were mostly sampling and

34
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:51,430
random numbers from various distributions and

35
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:57,180
looking at, well, the mean standard deviation and

36
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:01,840
overall shape of those distributions. It was the

37
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,580
third exercise that was the more challenging one

38
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,380
for more folks.

39
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,140
And.

40
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:21,970
In particular.

41
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:27,120
If there were

42
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:30,090
a.

43
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:43,920
Relatively small fraction of the submissions that

44
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:48,690
we're able to get, the expected standard deviation

45
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:53,220
in the total length of the of the random walk,

46
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:56,670
which was this parameter L2 defined in the

47
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:02,220
exercise and not redefined here. And I was also

48
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,420
surprised that no one.

49
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:09,580
No one chose to take the hint from the assignment

50
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:15,130
that we could look at. Correlated results for

51
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,880
these random walks going up two to five hundred

52
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,500
steps, which let's just take, say, 400 of those

53
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,770
500 steps and call that a 400 step walk and not

54
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:30,250
have to recompute everything starting from scratch

55
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:33,250
each time that speeds things up quite

56
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:37,360
significantly, gets things to run in about.

57
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,540
Thirty seconds as opposed to. Thirty minutes.

58
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:55,730
That's shown both in the PEF Solutions as well as

59
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:01,010
they shut down some of these tabs, as well as the

60
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:04,730
corresponding Python code that can just be

61
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:10,160
downloaded rather than viewed. Online, so all of

62
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:18,440
that is up on the site and see if any questions

63
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:18,980
have.

64
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:26,770
Come in while I was taking a quick look through

65
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:27,280
that.

66
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:58,000
So with no questions from. An interview, I think,

67
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,360
will.

68
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:08,890
Pick up with going over the last bit of that week,

69
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:13,110
five material on thermodynamic and thermodynamic

70
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:17,520
cycles based on the ideal gas law, and I'm sure

71
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,820
we'll wrap that up today and see how much of the

72
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:24,210
grand economical ensemble. We'll get through and

73
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:28,140
how much will remain for Thursday.

74
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,710
Those of you who have taken a look at the week six

75
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:40,670
material will see there's a lot of parallels with

76
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:43,730
the introduction of the canonical ensemble, just a

77
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:48,050
messier arithmetic coming from the ability now to

78
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:52,010
change the particle number as well as changing the

79
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:52,880
entropy. But.

80
00:06:55,330 --> 00:07:00,510
OK. I was just about to move on, but a question

81
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:05,730
did come in at the last minute. Relating to

82
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:10,740
question two in the homework assignment that I can.

83
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:19,520
Hopefully pull up reasonably quickly. Here looking

84
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:19,940
at.

85
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:30,960
The diffusion of an oil spill in water where we

86
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:38,370
see if I can get this into some program, that will

87
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:41,370
let me. Mark it up.

88
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:50,390
And the question was, were given that.

89
00:07:54,710 --> 00:08:02,790
There is quite a bit of. Oil in the water, and

90
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:07,590
they need to rearrange the screen slightly in

91
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:09,210
order to get around the.

92
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,270
Zoom screen sharing.

93
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,370
Interface.

94
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,000
So there's quite a bit of oil in the water and

95
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,930
they want to know how long it will take until some

96
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:28,850
fraction of that.

97
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,970
Has reached a marine protected area in the

98
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:38,810
question was how to convert these large numbers of

99
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:43,910
one hundred or a thousand tons to a number of oil

100
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:44,630
droplets.

101
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:55,630
In the answer is that you don't need to if you.

102
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:05,890
Look at ratios of the total amount of oil. That

103
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,290
we're concerned about relative to the overall.

104
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:17,470
Amounts, then the units are going to drop out of

105
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:23,350
that ratio and just a pure number will result.

106
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:30,200
And if that's possibly illegible, zoom in a bit

107
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:34,000
and rewrite it and hopefully do the math correctly.

108
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:36,230
So looking at ratios.

109
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:39,980
Gets rid of the need to.

110
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:47,100
Convert's. Units between tons of oil and oil

111
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:47,880
droplets.

112
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,830
And. Getting.

113
00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:01,700
Back to people everywhere, hopefully that was the.

114
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:11,120
Straightforward response, and I'm not hearing any

115
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:18,620
objections to it, I think Will. Hop back to. Just

116
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:21,290
catching up to where we were at the end of last

117
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:25,700
time on Thursday, looking at. The Karno cycle

118
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:31,170
shown here. In this diagram or the.

119
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:38,720
More physical illustration below it. We had gone

120
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,320
through.

121
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:47,850
The pressure volume diagram here where two of

122
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:48,360
these.

123
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:52,370
Curves are also therms.

124
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,150
And the other two

125
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:03,710
are 80 events, the temperature fixed and so therms,

126
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:06,260
the entropy fixed in 80 events.

127
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:16,880
And we had computed that. This current cycle is a

128
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,690
well-defined thermodynamic cycle, so long as.

129
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:28,450
This unspecified volume, the study D d obeys.

130
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:34,250
A single condition. That.

131
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:48,390
This ratio of. VTE overeasy is the same as the.

132
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:50,630
Over Vehbi.

133
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,280
And from that.

134
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:07,880
He moved on or we were going to move on to

135
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:14,980
considering how much work this cycle does. On its

136
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:19,600
surroundings, compared to the amount of heat that

137
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:22,840
is needed to run it, which

138
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:30,460
defines the efficiency of the cycle, so hopping

139
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:35,050
down to page 79, just to

140
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,720
give the a quick reminder that the efficiency ADA

141
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,960
is the network being done by the cycle. So the

142
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:48,400
difference between the work that the cycle is, the

143
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,700
system is able to do on its surroundings in each

144
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:58,570
iteration of the cycle, minus the work that the

145
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:02,140
surroundings, for example, us have to do on that

146
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:06,880
system in order to get the cycle to operate. And

147
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,720
then that's divided by the amount of heat that has

148
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,170
to be pumped into the system, into the system in

149
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:15,670
each iteration of the cycle.

150
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:24,860
Ignoring the amount of heat that is expelled as

151
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:30,840
waste feeds into into some cold reservoir. Where

152
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,030
the heat coming in, we think it was coming in from

153
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:37,380
some hot reservoir and that overall picture of two

154
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:40,620
reservoirs in contact with our system, one of them

155
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,870
hot and one of them cold, allow the heat to flow

156
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:50,540
is the basic overarching picture of. Thermodynamic

157
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:54,710
cycles, that's that was introduced by the carbon

158
00:13:54,710 --> 00:14:00,320
cycle even a few decades before ideas of of heat

159
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,030
and entropy were in themselves well defined.

160
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:09,380
So the first question. Well, we went through the.

161
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:15,690
For processes in the cargo cycle and saw in

162
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:21,900
general that the efficiency is given with some

163
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:25,710
cancellations just by one, plus the ratio of the

164
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:30,210
work done on the low temperature isothermal

165
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,990
compression relative to the amount of work done in

166
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:36,860
the high temperature isothermal expansion.

167
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:43,710
And just to check in that this calculation didn't

168
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:48,450
prove problematic for anyone, they'll compute what

169
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:52,560
those two values of the work are, starting from

170
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:58,950
page 79, the work done at high temperatures. In.

171
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:09,640
In that isothermal expansion from. Point A to

172
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:13,150
point B. Let me give you a.

173
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:19,640
A couple of minutes to check that results and

174
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:25,280
the answer or get your results in from among these

175
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,770
four options shown here.

176
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:48,840
You know, there are so many of us today that don't

177
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,900
have too many responses yet, and in case that

178
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:58,680
means this is a tricky situation that you're still

179
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:03,090
working on. I'll give you another few seconds to

180
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:06,560
wrestle with it.

181
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:13,800
Let's see what we have here at this point.

182
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:24,710
Well, there is unanimous agreement on

183
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,010
the answer, it's a

184
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:33,140
unanimity of one, so maybe the safe thing to do is

185
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:39,680
just to make sure that you see how this goes in

186
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:45,530
case it is causing trouble for the rest of you on

187
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:46,550
here, where

188
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:53,090
from the ideal gas law, the starting point, we

189
00:19:53,090 --> 00:20:00,260
have a relation between this pressure as a

190
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:06,050
function of the volume. And since this is that

191
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:11,780
expansion from point A to B on the high

192
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:14,180
temperature side of the carto cycle, when it's

193
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:17,750
bringing in from the reservoir, we know that the

194
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:23,330
appropriate temperature is the high temperature of

195
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:26,540
the reservoir, which is a constant that we can

196
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:31,070
pull up front of the integral that leaves us just

197
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:31,460
with.

198
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:42,850
Integral over of over Overbey, which is then the

199
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:47,200
logarithm of the volume and the difference of the

200
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,640
logs gives us the logarithm of the ratio, and I

201
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:56,350
can absorb that negative sign by reversing the

202
00:20:56,350 --> 00:21:03,400
order. And at the same time, so in the pressure

203
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:09,110
and volume in place of the number of particles and

204
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,330
high temperature

205
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:17,860
from that top left corner of

206
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:30,380
the TV diagram for the current cycle so that the

207
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:31,960
times the log is indeed

208
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:39,730
what that one response came up with. And maybe the

209
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:43,840
thing to do now is to check, to see whether.

210
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:48,930
Going through that example.

211
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:55,030
Gives some insight into the other piece of the

212
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:59,320
work that we need for the efficiency, which is the

213
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,830
work that has to be done on the system rather than

214
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:07,390
being done by the system, which we compress

215
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,680
along those lines, CTD

216
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:15,850
expelling heat to

217
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:21,760
the cold reservoir rather than bringing heat in

218
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:23,710
from the hot reservoir.

219
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:52,940
No, wait a minute or two for that

220
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:57,730
correspondent calculation out there to be done for

221
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:59,090
or looked up.

222
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:48,930
Lyndsey's anyone.

223
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:56,130
Still working on this calculation.

224
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:50,830
Not hearing any requests for more time. Take a

225
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:54,340
look again that there is.

226
00:26:57,510 --> 00:27:01,140
Unanimous response of one, which I think the safe

227
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:06,930
thing to do is to. Go through it in that case, in

228
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:11,940
case the low response rate means that finding this.

229
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:17,570
Tricky as well, we are now, it's the same

230
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:24,590
principle as the previous calculational, the this

231
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:28,280
time we have the low temperature from the cold

232
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:35,350
reservoir and the argument of the Lord has. That

233
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,190
opposite's.

234
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:42,310
Order. I have got the negative sign out front, so

235
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:46,150
it's VMD over D.C., which then gets.

236
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:52,220
Flipped into say.

237
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:59,440
The pressure and volume from that point see

238
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:02,770
connected to the low temperature of the cold

239
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:07,690
reservoir in B.C. over VMD, which was not one of

240
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:10,840
the options in the poll, we can.

241
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:18,640
Recognize from what we went through last week to

242
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:24,460
check that the carto cycle is a well defined cycle,

243
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:30,130
that this ratio of volumes has to be satisfied in

244
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:34,120
order for that cycle to close. And we can also.

245
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:44,680
Use the the work that we did last time.

246
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:52,260
Computing the ratio. Of the temperatures to

247
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:55,620
identify this.

248
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:04,730
In times, the low temperature in terms of.

249
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:15,470
The same pay and VA that we worked with in the

250
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:20,720
previous little activity where that ratio of

251
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:25,400
temperatures was the corresponding ratio of the

252
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,300
volumes

253
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:32,990
to the power, two thirds to satisfy the cost of

254
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:35,510
entropy condition of the adiabatic processes that

255
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:38,150
take us from one of those temperatures to the

256
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:38,990
other. So.

257
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:43,810
Plaguing all that in.

258
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,580
We end up with.

259
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:58,870
Very nearly the same.

260
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:05,210
Results as last time, just with the difference now

261
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:09,500
of this extra factor of the volumes and. A

262
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,960
different orientation

263
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:18,050
of the fraction in the log, the larger volume TVB,

264
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:24,020
rather than the smaller volume HVA, which we can.

265
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:29,930
Also, feel free to use the properties of logs to

266
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:37,130
flip that back and pull a negative sign out front

267
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:39,510
so that when we plug

268
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:47,750
both of those results into the expression we got

269
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:53,890
for the efficiency, this tablet behaves itself.

270
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:02,180
We just get that ratio of the volumes to the two

271
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:02,930
thirds.

272
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:11,280
You have the one out front and negative sign.

273
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:19,610
In that ratio of the volumes is just the ratio of.

274
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:24,490
The temperatures that we can check is.

275
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:33,230
Always not negative and also.

276
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:42,180
Less than one with the efficiency only reaching

277
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:44,160
one when either the.

278
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:49,820
The low temperature of the cold reservoir goes to

279
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:53,330
absolute zero or the high temperature of the

280
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,820
reservoir goes to infinity, neither of which are

281
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:59,450
terribly physical situations.

282
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:03,450
So.

283
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:11,310
Are there any questions about the Kado cycle,

284
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:15,750
because that's all that I had planned to discuss

285
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:18,360
about it, though it seemed to.

286
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:25,680
Proved trickier than I was anticipating.

287
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:31,370
Given that.

288
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:46,570
Trickiness it may be. Smart to keep looking at

289
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:49,780
some of the damage cycles. Maybe even more

290
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:53,580
conceptually for. A few more minutes and possibly

291
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:58,230
all of the remaining time today just to make sure

292
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:04,570
that these. Apparent difficulties grinding through

293
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:09,310
the integrals and arithmetic are not. Getting in

294
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:12,610
the way of understanding the the important

295
00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:14,590
concepts in this material.

296
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:30,680
And.

297
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:35,210
Perhaps these more.

298
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:41,150
Conceptual, unless.

299
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:49,170
Listen, knowingly quantitative integration

300
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:52,080
questions might be a little more fun and

301
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:58,760
interesting for us to consider here or for. The

302
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:02,240
folks watching the recording, if anyone, is later

303
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:02,540
on.

304
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:13,800
Where if we go back to. Our starting points for.

305
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:18,160
Well, not even the Kano's cycle, but

306
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:26,200
these pressure volume diagrams in general, we saw

307
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:29,560
that they were useful because the key equations

308
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:33,760
that we have for thermodynamic cycles allow us to

309
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:39,370
relate to all of the large scale properties of the

310
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:44,020
macroscopic system, its macro state. So the

311
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:47,920
temperature, entropy, internal energy, pressure

312
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:52,270
and volume can all be related just to the pressure

313
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:56,560
and volume through the ideal gas law. The

314
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:00,280
condition for constant entropy and relation

315
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,980
between the energy and temperature and that lets

316
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:07,300
us represents the behavior of systems by these

317
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:11,080
pressure volume diagrams. But of course, if we can

318
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:16,900
solve for systems in terms of the two variables,

319
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:19,960
pressure and volume, we can also swap those out

320
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:25,810
for two of the other properties of the system. And

321
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:31,270
one common choice that is sometimes useful is

322
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:36,670
looking at. The properties of these systems in

323
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:41,830
terms of their temperature, so putting

324
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:45,880
temperatures high on horizontal axis and the

325
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:48,730
entropy s on the vertical axis.

326
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:59,140
And the question that we can consider is, how does

327
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:04,300
the kurnos cycle look in this representation in

328
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:09,190
terms of temperature, entropy diagrams rather than.

329
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:14,510
Pressure, volume, diagrams, so I'll sketch out,

330
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:21,490
say, for. Possibilities say. The circle.

331
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:28,830
Were some rectangle.

332
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:40,050
You have whips.

333
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:49,590
If the two stages. Going down to the right sort of

334
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:56,290
approximation of. The kind of picture that. We do

335
00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:04,360
need more capably in the attacks or those sort of.

336
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:09,640
Curves that go off to the right instead of down to

337
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:16,990
the right, and those are the four options that are

338
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:19,450
now up in the latest poll.

339
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:27,370
Well, wait just a minute or so since there

340
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:32,610
detailed calculations are needed here, just. Quick

341
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:34,590
selection from that list.

342
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,230
Looking at the

343
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:53,290
results, there is an agreement that it's the

344
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:54,730
rectangle is.

345
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:05,110
The isothermal processes in the kanoa cycle keep

346
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:10,410
the temperature constant. And he is fixed value,

347
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:12,330
which is a vertical line on this font, and then

348
00:40:12,330 --> 00:40:15,690
the adiabatic processes keep the entropy constant

349
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:20,400
leading to a fixed line there so that maybe it was.

350
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:25,890
Two simple rather than two difficult, maybe.

351
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:32,210
We can spend the remaining minutes by.

352
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:42,020
Addressing one question, that or one issue that

353
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:45,230
came up here comes up at the end of the notes,

354
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:52,940
which is that the cycle is mathematically elegant

355
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:56,780
because it realizes the maximum possible

356
00:40:57,290 --> 00:41:01,670
efficiency of a thermodynamic cycle. The problem

357
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:04,640
is it's not useful for anything in practice

358
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:10,910
because these two isothermal processes. Going from

359
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:17,810
A to B and C to D have to be slow in order to keep

360
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:20,180
the temperature fixed with a sufficient amount of

361
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:24,460
of heat exchange at every stage in that process.

362
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:29,690
So trying to get any actual work out of a physical

363
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:34,070
realization of the cardio cycle is

364
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:40,340
not practical. It just takes too long in order for

365
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:44,720
the cycle to run. But even so, in the eighteen

366
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:49,640
hundreds, this relatively abstract mathematical

367
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:53,750
cycle inspired of some more practical applications,

368
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:58,430
starting with a cycle that's known as the diesel

369
00:41:58,430 --> 00:42:02,240
cycle. After Rudolf Diesel, who developed it and

370
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:05,810
was directly inspired by the cycle. And there's a

371
00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:10,910
similar and even simpler cycle known as the auto

372
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:14,120
cycle. Again named after a German physicist,

373
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:23,900
Nicholas Otto, which provides a good model of what

374
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:27,620
an internal combustion engine is doing. And in the

375
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,580
cycle,

376
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:31,760
we have a.

377
00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:38,400
Pressure volume diagram of this sort.

378
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:47,620
To the extent I can grow cleanly.

379
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:52,260
The cycle goes.

380
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:58,980
From these points, one, two, three and four with.

381
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:01,890
Both of the.

382
00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:12,090
Curved portions being adiabatic processes

383
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:18,930
and then back to one as a slow cycle, so quick

384
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:23,100
question just to sort of pressure volume, just to

385
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:27,720
check that you're able to read these pressure

386
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:33,060
volume diagrams without difficulty, I can ask in

387
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:40,560
this auto cycle, where are the highest and lowest

388
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:44,680
temperatures? Which are those four points? You

389
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:46,510
have the highest and lowest temperatures.

390
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:54,630
So we'll put the cycle back up on the screen.

391
00:43:56,630 --> 00:44:00,080
So then you don't have to be able to look at since

392
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:02,840
it's not in the notes.

393
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:40,630
Immune responses are coming in and time is running

394
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:45,100
out, so there'll be another minute or less before

395
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:48,940
I move on to the question of the efficiency of

396
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:49,650
this cycle.

397
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:00,920
So let's see.

398
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:04,830
There is.

399
00:46:08,190 --> 00:46:09,360
You're 100 percent.

400
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:16,030
Identifying will the same locations for the high

401
00:46:16,030 --> 00:46:18,460
and low temperatures. As for the current cycle, so

402
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:24,700
maybe that was a way to check the results. We can

403
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:27,430
also think about what the pressure volume diagram

404
00:46:27,430 --> 00:46:30,550
is describing that in the first stage, from one to

405
00:46:30,550 --> 00:46:33,610
two, we compress the system, push into a smaller

406
00:46:33,610 --> 00:46:36,310
volume, and then from two to three, there's a big

407
00:46:36,310 --> 00:46:39,460
change in the pressure at a fixed volume, which is

408
00:46:39,470 --> 00:46:43,150
an internal combustion engine is realized not by

409
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:45,520
putting the system into thermal contact with the

410
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:48,970
large external heat reservoir, but by lighting

411
00:46:48,970 --> 00:46:52,480
some fuel on fire and bringing a lot of heat in

412
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:56,020
that way. That gives a very rapid change in

413
00:46:56,020 --> 00:47:00,250
pressure even faster than the volume can respond

414
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:02,380
with that higher pressure than pushes the volume

415
00:47:02,830 --> 00:47:08,830
back out again. Idiomatically, to point for that

416
00:47:08,830 --> 00:47:12,100
expansion lowers the temperature from its peak at

417
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:17,650
three. And then the final step is reducing the

418
00:47:17,650 --> 00:47:20,830
temperature at a fixed volume, which in a

419
00:47:20,830 --> 00:47:24,970
practical advice is done by actually swapping out

420
00:47:24,970 --> 00:47:29,290
the the hot gas and replacing it with some colder

421
00:47:29,290 --> 00:47:32,620
gas. And that forms exhaust from the engine rather

422
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:37,620
than letting it cool just by heat exchange. Now, a

423
00:47:37,630 --> 00:47:39,970
little exercise that we won't go through, but

424
00:47:39,970 --> 00:47:43,630
might make a fun home. More question later in the

425
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:49,000
term is the efficiency of the auto cycle, which

426
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:53,590
turns out to be the.

427
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:59,160
Similar form to the efficiency of the Kano's cycle,

428
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:05,280
but with this temperature, the ratio that shows up

429
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:10,080
is the ratio of that temperature point for two

430
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:15,210
point three. So on either side of the adiabatic

431
00:48:15,210 --> 00:48:20,850
process, which is also, it turns out, the ratio of

432
00:48:20,850 --> 00:48:26,010
the temperatures between points one and points to

433
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:33,750
it since we saw just now in the question that this

434
00:48:34,770 --> 00:48:40,020
temperature for while it is larger than

435
00:48:41,610 --> 00:48:47,310
temperature three, it is less than the temperature.

436
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:49,650
One, the low temperature.

437
00:48:52,090 --> 00:48:57,190
So it's less than Cee Lo, whereas T three is T

438
00:48:57,310 --> 00:48:57,820
high.

439
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:07,310
You can see that because the eye should make a

440
00:49:07,310 --> 00:49:09,440
better distinction between the ages of my four as

441
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:09,980
possibly.

442
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:20,780
That temperature T4 is greater than temperature C

443
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:26,970
h. So if we. Plug that in, you see that this

444
00:49:26,970 --> 00:49:32,070
efficiency is strictly less than that of the Karno

445
00:49:32,070 --> 00:49:35,760
cycle, as we could have expected from the results

446
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:39,840
in the notes that the cardio cycle has the maximum

447
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:41,000
possible efficiency.

448
00:49:45,990 --> 00:49:50,700
So that is it for today and for three remix cycles.

449
00:49:52,410 --> 00:49:54,840
Did it get to the grand canonical ensemble that

450
00:49:54,840 --> 00:50:01,670
will come along on Thursday? Looking at the

451
00:50:02,090 --> 00:50:06,260
chemical potential and some of the relations

452
00:50:06,530 --> 00:50:11,160
between the emergent properties of grand

453
00:50:11,170 --> 00:50:14,390
economical systems related to the great economical

454
00:50:14,390 --> 00:50:18,980
potential, I'll wrap it up now, shut down the

455
00:50:19,490 --> 00:50:21,500
meeting in a couple of minutes to get that

456
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:25,310
recording saved. And if there are any final

457
00:50:25,310 --> 00:50:28,400
questions about thermodynamic cycles, feel free to

458
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:31,760
bring them up or head off to enjoy the rest of

459
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:32,140
your day.

460
00:50:42,930 --> 00:50:47,180
In the office hours will be in this. Same room

461
00:50:47,230 --> 00:50:52,840
about five minutes after I've got Zoom shut down

462
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:53,830
and restarted.
