00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:05,570
Hello and welcome back to the end of week four of

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,760
statistical physics, a wrap up video of

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:13,260
summarizing the highlights and learning outcomes

4
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:21,420
of Idil gases. And with the new screen shared set

5
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:27,860
up, I'm experimenting with. This week, some of

6
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:32,330
these key takeaway messages may have been clear to

7
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:36,230
see as we went through just the introductory

8
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:39,410
overview in the previous video, I will say

9
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,980
different things about them this time going

10
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:46,220
through, starting with the assumption that you've

11
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,800
gone through, read the written material and

12
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,940
checked your comprehension with those gaps. The.

13
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:58,000
The activities put in place just to make sure

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,350
everything is falling into place, so in terms of

15
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:06,310
the definition of ideal, gas is what really

16
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:11,720
matters here is the definition of the energy. And

17
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:18,380
all of these adjectives and English is essentially

18
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:24,590
defined by how we specify the energy and writing

19
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:27,590
the energy in this form, that there are no

20
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,620
relativistic corrections, there are no

21
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:34,670
contributions from particle interactions, and

22
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:37,310
there are no contributions from quantum effects,

23
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:40,850
really defines what we mean by this non

24
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:43,010
relativistic classical ideal gas.

25
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:50,130
And another aspect of the definition of the energy

26
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:55,470
is the ZATZ reimposed that the momenta are

27
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,460
descriptivist or quantized, which does turn out to

28
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:03,780
come from quantum mechanics and leads to discrete

29
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,560
values of the energy corresponding to the discrete

30
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:13,290
moments that are possible in the volume that we

31
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:19,830
have to define as a place for this ideal gas to be

32
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:25,230
situated. So even the. Construction of the

33
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:27,630
partition function from which all the

34
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:31,110
characteristics of the system are derived depends

35
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:36,570
on having a finite volume of finite L with the

36
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:42,410
volume of L cubed. That gives us these quantize

37
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:46,520
momentum and energy levels here as nonsense in

38
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:51,740
nature, as an aspect of quantum physics and.

39
00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:00,810
A related aspect is you may you may have picked up

40
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:04,320
as we went through this derivation of the

41
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:09,600
partition function, that we first democratized the

42
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:12,780
energies into discrete energy levels so that we

43
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:18,420
could do a well-defined sum over microstates. And

44
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,270
then we made the assumption that all those energy

45
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:23,640
levels were close enough that we could go back to

46
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:27,030
treating them as continuous and approximates these

47
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:33,120
sums as continuous integrals. And this here is the

48
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:37,890
condition that allows us to go back and forth. And

49
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:42,090
this is another aspect of what it means to have a

50
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,740
classical, non relativistic ideal gas in this

51
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:51,360
mathematical context. And in particular, we are

52
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:55,140
making the assumption that the particle masses,

53
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:58,410
the temperature and all this parameter that

54
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:03,480
controls the volume of the gas are all large in

55
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,860
units of Planck's constant, which is just a unit

56
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:11,880
conversion factor that in most fields of physics

57
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:16,200
just gets set to one here. We keep it explicit to

58
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:20,850
remind ourselves of the the classical and quantum

59
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:25,920
limits where this ratio is small or not so small,

60
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:30,420
respectively. And this also shows up in the

61
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:35,940
generally wavelength defined to simplify some of

62
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:40,020
the notation, see that this depends on the.

63
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:44,280
Critical mass and the temperature, and it shows up

64
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:49,920
in combination with the volume. So that, say, when

65
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,520
if we jump down to the result that we got from the

66
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:59,280
partition function for the entropies right here,

67
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:04,920
we see that the volume over the cube of the

68
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,880
thermal wavelength always show up together and.

69
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:15,680
As the temperature is very small, the severally

70
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:19,460
wavelength gets relatively large, and when it

71
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:23,330
becomes comparable to the linear size of this

72
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:27,560
volume, l getting the volume L cubed, that is when

73
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,960
this law vanishes. And that is why we have to

74
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:33,980
start worrying about quantum effects. And a

75
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:40,700
similar sort of behavior can happen with the

76
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,370
devilly wavelength becoming comparable to the

77
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:47,600
total volume of the system when the mass similarly

78
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,940
gets very small, or if we turn things around, we

79
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:55,220
can keep the wavelength fixed and imagine the

80
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:58,670
volume becoming very small, which will also break

81
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:03,660
down the. Approximation of classical, non

82
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,130
relativistic ideal gas. So that is how all of

83
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:10,190
those aspects of the systems we're considering

84
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:12,890
show up in the mathematics here

85
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:20,250
and the other aspect that. Was emphasized even in

86
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:25,320
the overview was the. Effect that the intrinsic

87
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,770
information content of the system had on the

88
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:32,640
entropy, though not on the average internal energy,

89
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,940
that depending on whether or not the particles

90
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,970
were distinguishable, we would count different

91
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:45,220
numbers of microstates for a. Particular set of

92
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:49,830
momentum for the particles. Which in turn led to

93
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:55,440
both different amounts of entropy and also

94
00:06:56,190 --> 00:07:00,570
different dependence of the entropy on the.

95
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,390
Possibility of particle exchange and the

96
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:09,040
introduction of additional particles into these

97
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,360
canonical systems.

98
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:19,270
And. What I glossed over in the overview was the

99
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:22,360
connection to the so-called Gibbs paradox and how

100
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:26,530
paradoxes avoided where the Gibbs paradox is.

101
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:35,190
What you get if you are too quick to use arguments

102
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:38,820
that assume indistinguishable particles and apply

103
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:41,730
those to the distinguishable particle case where

104
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:45,000
we saw in the case of indistinguishable particles,

105
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:50,070
removing or reinserting the barrier between two

106
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:56,170
canonical ensembles has no effect. On the system

107
00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:00,500
and in particular, the entropy is simply unchanged

108
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,890
as they go through that process.

109
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:12,120
When we compute the. Entropy for this case of

110
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:16,590
distinguishable particles, when we remove the

111
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:19,110
barrier, double the number of particles and double

112
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:22,860
the volume of the system, we find this non-zero

113
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:27,300
mixing entropy. And if we repeat the same argument

114
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:31,530
that led to this result, we would seem to see the

115
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:36,960
entropy increasing as we go from the initial set

116
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,770
up to the combined system and then decreasing back

117
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:45,930
to that final set up at the end once the barrier

118
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:50,040
is reinserted. And the key is that the.

119
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:54,200
Distinguishable particles allow us really to

120
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,690
distinguish the micro states that we're starting

121
00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:01,310
off with so that there is only one possible way to

122
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:05,540
get back to those in. What typically happens is

123
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:10,880
that the initial microstates are scrambled as the

124
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:15,590
barrier is removed and reinserted, so we end up

125
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:19,010
with possibly or quite likely the same number of

126
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:22,880
particles in each of the final systems, but.

127
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:28,970
Different particles with different labels as we

128
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:33,170
remove and reinsert that barrier compared to our

129
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:38,270
starting position. So the final system can no

130
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:42,050
longer be identified with the initial one and the

131
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:46,190
full calculation has to be carried out, which does

132
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:48,680
end up it's not a calculation that's worth doing

133
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,670
in in this module. In this context, it ends up

134
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:55,280
being consistent with the second law of

135
00:09:55,280 --> 00:10:00,510
thermodynamics. And the final topic we have is a

136
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:04,200
physics result that is just as famous as the

137
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,490
second law of thermodynamics and a bit more of a

138
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:14,070
concrete. Application to physical systems carried

139
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:18,300
out over the years. This is the ideal gas law that

140
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:23,160
results from defining the pressure as the

141
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:27,450
adiabatic change or response of the internal

142
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:32,160
energy of a system to a change in volume. And this

143
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,570
negative sign here is what we would expect from

144
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:41,190
everyday experience that say if we decrease the

145
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:44,610
volume, we squeeze the system, we expect its

146
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:47,250
energy to increase. There's more stuff being

147
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:51,180
crammed into a smaller volume. So the overall

148
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:55,140
change is an increasing numerator, decreasing

149
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:58,440
denominator. So a negative sign there that cancels

150
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,620
out that overall negative sign and gives the

151
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:09,740
positive pressure of squeezing a volume. And. Yes,

152
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,350
adiabatic simply means a constant entropy process,

153
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:19,930
which is related to this particular combination of

154
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,840
the volume and temperature that appear in the

155
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:26,800
entropy for both the cases of distinguishable and

156
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:32,900
indistinguishable particles. And. Perhaps the.

157
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:37,540
Final comment to emphasize here is that as we.

158
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:42,430
Talk about these adiabatic processes that change

159
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:46,780
both the volume and the temperature of the system

160
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,980
so as to keep this combination constant and keep

161
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:56,450
the entropy constant. We can notice that we are

162
00:11:56,930 --> 00:12:00,500
doing a bit out of the bounds of the canonical

163
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:04,460
ensemble, which started by fixing the temperature

164
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:08,150
through thermal contact with a large external

165
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:11,090
thermal reservoir. What we went through last week

166
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:15,530
here, when we consider processes that are changing

167
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:18,950
the temperature, we really have in mind that we

168
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:24,500
are. Moving our system from. Being described in

169
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,920
terms of one canonical ensemble with a particular

170
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,130
initial temperature to a final state, where is

171
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:35,570
described in terms of a different but related

172
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,000
canonical ensemble with the same number of

173
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,030
particles, but a different volume and different

174
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:45,890
temperature. So in particular, we take our system

175
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:49,670
and disconnect its certainly contact with an

176
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:52,520
existing reservoir at the initial temperature and

177
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:56,270
reconnect it to a different thermal reservoir with

178
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:59,660
a different temperature at the end. And in that

179
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:03,800
process, we also change the volume in order to

180
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:08,930
keep the entropy constant, ending up with the

181
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:12,350
ideal gas law of the equation of states describing

182
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:17,540
how the macro state of the system changes with

183
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:22,400
this change in temperature and volume, with the

184
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:26,820
number of particles fixed connecting the pressure

185
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,570
of volume, temperature and number of particles,

186
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:33,800
and through the definition of the pressure, also

187
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,640
bringing in the internal entropy sorry internal

188
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,610
energy and constant entropy as a function of

189
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:45,740
volume in that ideal gas law is.

190
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:51,690
The most famous equation of state out there, that

191
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:54,300
there is the equation of state being a relation

192
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:59,610
between these macroscopic parameters and next week

193
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:03,240
looking at through dynamical cycles, we will take

194
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:08,790
this equation of state and apply it to do work by

195
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:12,930
moving heat around or equivalently apply work to

196
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:18,810
move heat around as a physical application of

197
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:22,650
statistical physics and the canonical ensemble.
