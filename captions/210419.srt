1
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:08,110
OK, I've got the recording underway and may spend.

2
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:12,460
A couple of minutes going over some of the usual

3
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:15,250
logistical issues, while perhaps more folks will

4
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:20,590
be able to to sign in on this bright Monday

5
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:23,770
morning in Liverpool and.

6
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:29,780
We start off with the usual link to people

7
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:34,700
everywhere, which I think I will experiment with

8
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:40,010
using in a different way for at least the next few

9
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:45,450
days, depending on. How the number of folks were

10
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,420
able to make it to these secret sessions continues

11
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:53,610
to evolve. As the numbers decrease, it becomes a

12
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:58,920
bit more. Of a burden on each individual

13
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:04,410
participant to go back and forth between. Polls

14
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:10,110
and discussions, so I may just leave the the basic.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,680
Pull open, giving you the opportunity to ask any

16
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:19,500
questions and guide the course of what we

17
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,350
discussed today. And I will try to keep an eye on

18
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,400
both those results and zoom simultaneously. And

19
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:35,840
also invite you just to speak up in Zoome, if you

20
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,900
miss a written comment or you just want to ask a

21
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,550
question out loud.

22
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:49,050
And so with a reduced role of polls and quizzes

23
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:52,530
and those sorts of activities, what I think we can

24
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:55,860
spend some time profitably doing both for those of

25
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:59,310
you here who can direct the course of what we

26
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:03,000
discuss and for the folks checking out the

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,020
recording after the fact, just go through the

28
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:12,960
materials for for this weekend and last week. And

29
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,060
chat about some of the key conceptual issues that

30
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,800
are highlighted there, see if there are any

31
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,140
questions or confusions about those. And I may

32
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:28,460
also elaborate on some of the. Background or some

33
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:30,410
of the information that is not assumed as

34
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:33,980
background, but is being brought in as ANZAAS or

35
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:37,880
an assumption with regards to quantum physics,

36
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,340
photons, the nature of light and that sort of

37
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:40,720
thing.

38
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,890
So with that prelude, all pause for a minute or

39
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:48,980
two to see if there are any immediate questions

40
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:53,300
about those materials, not only for this week and

41
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:57,560
last, but any point throughout the the module. Any

42
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:02,360
questions about the computer project due last week

43
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:06,680
or the final homework that is due next week, a

44
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,630
week from tomorrow?

45
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:19,720
It helps, of course, if I remember to turn on the

46
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:22,570
screen, share where I am actually sharing.

47
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:26,690
Matt.

48
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,380
People everywhere question.

49
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:21,430
So not seeing or hearing. Any immediate questions

50
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:28,560
can pull up the materials going back to last week,

51
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:32,950
the topic of quantum statistics that this week

52
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:36,730
we're digging into a bit more in a more detailed

53
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:41,110
investigation of photon gases as the simplest

54
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:46,000
realization of a quantum statistical system of

55
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,510
Bosnich particles to be followed next week by

56
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,970
quantum statistical systems of thermionic

57
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:58,410
particles in the. Synchronous sessions last week,

58
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:01,770
we discussed pretty thoroughly not only the

59
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:05,340
background and previous parts of the module

60
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:09,030
leading up to the term break, but one of the two

61
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:13,440
main conceptual issues that comes in when we bring

62
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,380
in quantum statistics. Again, without assuming

63
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:21,310
familiarity with quantum mechanics, the issue we

64
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:24,550
discussed pretty thoroughly is the need to.

65
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:34,150
Revise or change how we define. The sum over

66
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:36,760
microstates that gives us the.

67
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,630
Partition function or grand canonical partition

68
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:48,250
function from which. Essentially, all aspects of

69
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:53,860
our statistical system can be derived in that is

70
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,040
always defined as the sum over microstates of the

71
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,010
Celsi, distinguishing between classical and

72
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:02,980
quantum statistics is how the individual

73
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:05,890
microstates are defined and distinguished from

74
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:08,410
each other, with the classical case involving

75
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:12,640
considering each particle in the system in turn in

76
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,650
something over all of the possible energies that

77
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:17,440
it could have. And then in the indistinguishable

78
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,740
case that is relevant for quantum particles, we

79
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:25,480
have to correct possible overcounting or fairly

80
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:29,110
ubiquitous overcounting in order to get the proper

81
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:34,110
number of microstates. And that works perfectly

82
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:37,680
well in a high temperature classical regime where

83
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:43,580
there is. A huge number of microstates available

84
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:46,400
compared to the number of particles in the system,

85
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,990
so there is a negligible probability for multiple

86
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:55,520
particles to simultaneously occupy the same energy

87
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:00,500
level. And the quantum regime where classical

88
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:03,560
statistical physics breaks down is distinguished

89
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,280
by the opposite behavior when there are relatively

90
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,620
few energy levels compared to the number of

91
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:12,770
particles occupying them. And there are then

92
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:17,540
subtleties in the overcounting coming from the

93
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:22,580
need to treat differently. Particles that are in

94
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,550
different energy levels or in the same energy

95
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:29,120
level, and we illustrated how that works with a

96
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:34,820
very simple example of the quantum system of two

97
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:37,910
particles that can be any in any one of five

98
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:41,570
energy levels where the mathematics is the same as

99
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:46,670
counting the number of ways that two balls can be

100
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:52,220
placed in any of five boxes. And the results of

101
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,980
the classical approach I described are going over

102
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:58,100
each ball, figuring out the number of boxes that

103
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,410
they could go in, the number of possibilities, and

104
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:05,630
then correcting for overcounting naively gives a

105
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:10,250
non integer number of possible microstates,

106
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,980
possible ways of distributing

107
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:17,480
these particles into the energy levels. And the

108
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:21,110
quantum correction to that is instead of.

109
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:25,860
Something over each particle and then all possible

110
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,940
energies, we sum over the possible energy levels

111
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:31,860
and then how many particles can be in each one,

112
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:37,100
the so-called occupation number? Which is the

113
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,410
concept we encountered when developing the

114
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:43,260
canonical and grand Kilmichael ensemble's. You

115
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:47,200
threw the the replica trick nonsense for the large

116
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,990
thermal reservoir and particle reservoir that

117
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:52,690
fixed the temperature and chemical potential in

118
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:58,570
these canonical and canonical approaches and with

119
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,880
the partition function.

120
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:08,260
Defined in this way as a sum over microstates. So

121
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:14,750
right up here. Then there is no further

122
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,120
overcounting to worry about, and we can just

123
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:22,680
proceed in a simple and straightforward way. So

124
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:27,180
that is the quick review of the longer discussions

125
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:31,110
and exercises and activities we went through last

126
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:37,250
week. And the. So before moving on to the other

127
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:41,540
key conceptual issue of Sevenoaks, of course, to

128
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:46,300
see if there are. Questions or comments about.

129
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:50,900
That issue of the quantum statistical approach.

130
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:16,620
So moving on, I will actually not jump straight to

131
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:17,730
the.

132
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:23,360
The key conceptual issue of the classical limits,

133
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,020
how quantum statistics and classical statistics.

134
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,870
Reproduce each other in the appropriate regime, so

135
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:36,840
that's classical physics familiar from Newton's

136
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,570
time and even before it can provide excellent

137
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:43,050
approximations to the natural world that is in a

138
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:46,110
more fundamental underlying level described by

139
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:53,220
quantum mechanics. Two things to. Highlights in

140
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:56,700
the intermediate sections comparing bosons and

141
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:00,210
fermions, the two types of quantum particles that

142
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:02,730
are distinguished by the possible occupation

143
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:04,110
numbers that they could have.

144
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:08,230
And.

145
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:14,340
I want to emphasize something that comes up a

146
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:18,630
little later on, which is that in all of the work

147
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,710
up through this week and even into next week, that

148
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:25,680
one guest is a fermions. We are still considering

149
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:30,240
idealized system so called ideal Das's, where the

150
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,170
individual particles are not interacting at all

151
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:37,770
with each other. If they come and approach each

152
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:39,900
other instead of colliding and bouncing off each

153
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,480
other, they simply pass straight through, have no

154
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,660
influence on each other, which provides enormous

155
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:48,420
simplifications which will come to appreciate more

156
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:53,420
when we. Drop that. Assumption or that

157
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:57,110
approximation in week ten and look at interacting

158
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:00,800
systems where things immediately become enormously

159
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,730
more complicated

160
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:09,860
one. Aspect of these non interacting particles

161
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:15,290
that might sound mysterious without having seen

162
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:17,450
the concepts of those kinds of fermions before, is

163
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:23,090
the issue of exactly how fermions as quantum

164
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:26,330
particles are set up so that at most a single

165
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:31,440
formation can occupy any given energy level? So

166
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,840
the intuitive but incorrect way of thinking about

167
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:42,360
this. Is to picture fermions as repelling each

168
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,360
other so that once one has claimed its energy

169
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,900
level, it forces out any other formula that might

170
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:52,950
try to come in there, just kicks it way off to the

171
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:59,100
curb so that it cannot join the. For the current

172
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,710
four million occupying the energy level in the way

173
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:04,650
that those zones are able to, but that would be

174
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:09,930
inconsistent with an approximation that the

175
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:12,720
particles we're working with are not interacting

176
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,580
and do not exert any forces on each other in in

177
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:17,810
any circumstances.

178
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:21,990
And the.

179
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:29,620
The real reason that criminals behave as they do

180
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:33,280
has to do with a feature of quantum mechanics that

181
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:35,860
is briefly summarized in the material but is

182
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:39,700
somewhat tangential to the course itself. And

183
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:44,050
there's no need to worry about or think about this

184
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:49,030
topic in order to extract the key information and

185
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:54,150
applications of statistical physics. But

186
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:58,520
essentially. For those who are curious, can spend

187
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:01,850
be synchronous sessions, elaborating a bit on some

188
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:06,050
aspects of this background that come into play and

189
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:09,980
connects to statistical physics, tying all of

190
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:13,550
modern physics and mathematics together into a

191
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:19,100
coherent description of the universe. And in

192
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:24,500
quantum mechanics, particles and in microwaves of

193
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:28,100
many particles are described by wave, what are

194
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:31,070
called wave functions, which are essentially the

195
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:36,620
square roots of probabilities defined at all

196
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:41,990
points in space and time. And those wave functions

197
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:48,640
are the technical term. For. What I call the

198
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,910
system in this paragraph, giving a bit of

199
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:57,940
supplementary background, so if we consider.

200
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:06,740
A system of two particles in my system here, I

201
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,840
mean, wavefunction that is conventionally written

202
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:13,490
as the uppercase Greek letter PSI, and we think

203
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:16,190
about parametrized in that way function in terms

204
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:21,470
of the positions of those two particles, X1 and X2.

205
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:27,680
And we ask what would happen if we took those two?

206
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:31,230
Identical, indistinguishable particles that

207
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:38,210
position X one index to. And just swap them the

208
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:42,630
particle at X one, moving to X to position X, to

209
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:45,000
particle X to moving to position X one.

210
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,900
And in three spatial dimensions.

211
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:53,750
Which is.

212
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:01,320
I think a footnote on the previous page here.

213
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:06,630
Where more interesting behavior is possible in

214
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:09,780
different set ups, for example, if we have

215
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:13,950
particles confined to the two dimensional surface

216
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:17,580
of the table, they can exhibit more exotic

217
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:21,030
behavior. But in three dimensions. The familiar

218
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:23,610
case that we operate in on the day to day basis,

219
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:29,250
there are only two possibilities for what happens

220
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,950
when we exchange these two identical particles

221
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:35,130
that are related to what I said earlier about the

222
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:38,910
wavefunction essentially being thought of as a

223
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:42,060
square root of a probability distribution because

224
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:48,550
the particles are identical. The the probability

225
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:52,930
for this set up is unchanged by swapping them, so

226
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:54,940
the probability is one and if we take the square

227
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:58,330
root, there are two possibilities, plus one and

228
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:00,850
minus one, both of which square to that

229
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:05,800
probability, one. So we can have. If the pen

230
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:09,580
writes, instead of changing the zoom of the page,

231
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:14,890
that procedure can lead to either that same.

232
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:19,320
System, that same wavefunction with a positive

233
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,480
sign, which is.

234
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:28,530
Behavior of those items or you can pick up that

235
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:31,680
negative sign that still squares to the same

236
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:35,790
probability distribution, which is the behavior of

237
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:36,570
fermions,

238
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,120
what we saw last week and earlier in these notes

239
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:47,120
that when the particles are occupying. That same

240
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:50,900
energy level, so this final column of the

241
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:54,380
possibilities that we considered in the simple

242
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:58,190
example case of two particles with five energy

243
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:01,970
levels, there really is only one energy level and

244
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:04,820
interchanging multiple particles in that energy

245
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:09,900
level. Introduces no change to the system or to

246
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:14,130
its wavefunction. So that is the system or that is

247
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:18,930
set up that would correspond to multiple fermions

248
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:22,320
in the same energy level where we would have that

249
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,080
same system equal to its negative or that same

250
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,210
wavefunction equal to as negative and therefore

251
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:31,560
vanishing. So no possibility of having fermions in

252
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,200
the same energy level, not due to any force or

253
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,870
interaction, but due to.

254
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:39,490
The.

255
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,390
Underlying fundamental description of quantum

256
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:47,840
particles, so that is a bit of elaboration on the

257
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,950
background there, how we can still be working with.

258
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:56,780
Not interacting particles that still are not able

259
00:18:56,780 --> 00:19:01,530
to. Share a share the same energy level.

260
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:04,460
And.

261
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:14,340
As I move on to the final section. Take a quick

262
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:20,640
check to look for questions or requests for topics

263
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:27,050
to discuss. I will note. In passing a statement

264
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:28,010
made in.

265
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:35,570
This derivation of the grand canonical partition

266
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:38,990
function for Bosnich particles having to do with

267
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:41,900
the convergence of the geometric series that

268
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:45,650
requires the exponential factor to be less than

269
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:52,670
one or equivalently, its arguments to be negative,

270
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:54,590
less than zero, which means that each individual

271
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:58,160
factor with a positive temperature and that

272
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,430
overall negative sign has to be greater than zero.

273
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:08,860
And I mentioned here that generically. We have the

274
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:11,900
lowest energy level set equal to zero, and in fact,

275
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:16,700
it is possible to shift all energy levels by a

276
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:20,270
constant factor without changing any expectation

277
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:24,470
values coming out of the statistical probability

278
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:31,070
space, which is a a derivation we can go through

279
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:36,590
or you can work out on your own. In that case, we

280
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:39,590
require a strictly negative chemical potential,

281
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:43,760
which those of you who have had a chance to look

282
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,930
at the materials for this week, even at 9:00 a.m.

283
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:50,180
on the Monday morning, will see that in the

284
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:54,650
photographs where we look at the simplest case of

285
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:56,870
an exactly vanishing chemical potential, which we

286
00:20:56,870 --> 00:21:02,100
are able to do by stepping back to the. Basic

287
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:05,520
underlying condition that the difference between

288
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,940
energy and chemical potential has to be positive

289
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,750
and for the photon gas at a finite volume. The.

290
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:17,950
Formulation of quantum mechanics of financially as

291
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:22,120
opposed to classical physics does forbid that zero

292
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,370
energy state, which is how we can get away with

293
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:29,110
that state, that simplification of a vanishing

294
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:30,820
chemical potential for photons.

295
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:36,090
And how that is consistent with this discussion

296
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:41,370
here, in case that might have caused any confusion

297
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:45,680
or might cause confusion in the future as you. Dig

298
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:49,550
into to the material for this week and compare it

299
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:52,790
with the derivation left from last week that we're

300
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:54,590
still discussing.

301
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:59,740
So hopping ahead past the.

302
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:04,700
Derivation of the Bose, Einstein and pheromone

303
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:07,460
Dirac Green canonical partition functions that

304
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:10,460
define quantum statistics for those two classes of

305
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:11,420
quantum particles.

306
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:17,770
You made the statements and looked at the plot

307
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,980
briefly last week that high temperatures are aware

308
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:25,060
classical physics should be a good approximation

309
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:29,170
to the underlying quantum behavior of the natural

310
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:34,760
world. And we demonstrated that by putting all

311
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:38,360
three of these statistical systems next to each

312
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:42,710
other. From the page here where we can already see

313
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:48,640
from these three equations. Where they are.

314
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:58,820
We're going to be. Reproducing each other is

315
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:02,300
actually maybe even easier to see when we take the

316
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:07,730
logarithm of the three to define the corresponding

317
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:10,940
grand canonical potentials. The usual way that we

318
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:14,330
manipulate and work with the partition function in

319
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:18,780
practical calculations. I can see that in the

320
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,690
limits where this exponential factor into the wind

321
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:26,490
speed of times, the energy of the energy level

322
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:32,730
minus the chemical potential, is much less than

323
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:37,620
one. We can expand these logarithms to linear

324
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:42,450
order in that factor. And all that remains is

325
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:46,290
precisely that factor. So the logarithm reduces to

326
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:49,500
the exponential factor, which is what we get in

327
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:53,340
the so-called Maxwell Boltzmann calculation

328
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,970
corresponding to the classical statistical

329
00:23:56,970 --> 00:24:00,120
approach of sending over particles and then over

330
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,550
all their possible energies, then correcting for

331
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:06,390
overcounting and similarly, in the Byzantine

332
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:10,230
Einstein case, expanding that logarithm to linear

333
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:13,500
order in a small exponential would bring out the

334
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:17,720
negative side. In addition to the exponential in

335
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,700
all three of these.

336
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:27,910
Canonical potentials end up. Agreeing as we

337
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:32,020
checked out visually on the the figure on the last

338
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:37,320
page of the section there is. Some calculation to

339
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:41,400
do the work to do to reach down to.

340
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:47,730
To that figure in that results on a quantitative

341
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:53,880
rather than conceptual level, which. Were you

342
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,240
about halfway through the day? There's time to

343
00:24:57,110 --> 00:25:00,810
quickly run through. These three calculations,

344
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:05,460
which are going to start to become routine and

345
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:09,480
quite familiar as we practice going through.

346
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:18,000
Through them one after the next, and just to

347
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:22,170
simplify some of the notation here, they may

348
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:28,430
rewrite things. In terms of. Just to each the

349
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:33,020
minus X, some L, the L was labeling each energy

350
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:39,410
level of our system. Now we are. Something over in

351
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:41,960
the quantum case and.

352
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:47,820
Rewriting the classical result in terms of so that.

353
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:56,490
Excel is the inverse temperature beat of times,

354
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:59,670
the energy of the energy level minus the chemical

355
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:01,440
potential and.

356
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:07,690
The derivative, well, I should have really changed

357
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:10,360
variables in the derivative itself that we can see

358
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:14,590
that it brings down a factor of Beita with a plus

359
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:16,750
sign from the two negative sides overall.

360
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:21,760
So we have a T and EBITA that cancel as their

361
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:26,530
inverses and then just the same exponential factor,

362
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:31,570
you the minus Extel, which we want to identify as.

363
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:37,620
A sum over the energy levels of the average

364
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:42,450
occupation number for each energy level in the

365
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:44,640
next Fogelson case.

366
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:50,290
The derivative is.

367
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:58,240
Just a bit. More work in the other two cases, but.

368
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:04,650
Proceeds in the same sort of way that. Now, in

369
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:09,810
addition to that factor of data here with three

370
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:14,380
negative signs coming. Along with it, so it's

371
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:20,290
minus T in the minus beta, and it needs of the

372
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:24,730
minus X comes along, the derivative of the log is

373
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:30,670
one divided by its arguments in the sun over

374
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:33,670
energy levels out front, which again, those are

375
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:36,070
cancelling and we end up with.

376
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:42,870
If some of your average occupation numbers for the

377
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:46,680
Bose Einstein quantum statistical distribution

378
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:50,070
appropriate for bosun's, where the occupation

379
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:52,440
numbers that we sum over for each energy level can

380
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:56,040
take any non negative value zero, one, two, three

381
00:27:56,040 --> 00:28:00,840
and off to infinity, depending on the total number

382
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:04,230
of particles in the micro state. That's the reason

383
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:08,070
we're working with the grand canonical ensemble to

384
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:12,570
keep things simple and straightforward and

385
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:17,040
something over the possible fluctuations in the

386
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,830
number of particles with a fixed chemical

387
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:25,510
potential. And. Very similar calculation in the

388
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:27,850
very direct case, with the only difference here

389
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:31,780
being how many negative signs there are and with

390
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:35,770
an even number of negative signs changing compared

391
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:40,990
to the those Einstein case, the results. Ends up

392
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:47,570
the same each the minus beta times. Exponential of

393
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:53,360
exponential minus data times energy minus chemical

394
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:58,410
potential. So the average occupation number for

395
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:02,690
that very direct distribution appropriate for

396
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:06,890
fermions, they can have only zero or one particle

397
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:09,620
per energy level. This is the only possible

398
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:14,020
occupation numbers. And what we just wrote down

399
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:18,740
match the results given here after dividing

400
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:24,170
through by the exponential factor e to the data

401
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:27,680
times differences in energy and chemical potential.

402
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:36,400
And we can obviously see the non conversions of

403
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,670
that, but as I sign distribution in the limit,

404
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:44,200
when the exponential factor here becomes E to the

405
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:47,110
zero, if the energy were ever equal to the

406
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:51,790
chemical potential, we have one divided by each of

407
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:55,750
the zero minus one, which diverges, as was also

408
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:59,680
shown in the figure we looked at fairly briefly.

409
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:07,260
Last week that if I add this is zero here where

410
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,690
that horizontal axis is precisely the.

411
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,370
Difference between energy and chemical potential.

412
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:17,730
So if that ever reaches zero and the Bose Einstein

413
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,960
distribution heads off to infinity before it gets

414
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:25,380
there, in contrast to the classical Maxwell

415
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:30,840
Boltzmann case. That diverges exponentially.

416
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:34,950
Where that X is the.

417
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:42,300
Horizontal axis. Down there and the very direct

418
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:47,500
case saturates the maximum possible occupation,

419
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:51,800
number four, and energy level with fermions where

420
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,080
the average occupation number is one, that means

421
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:02,590
that we always have a fermoy on in. In this energy

422
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:08,170
level, every every energy level is occupied, and

423
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:11,110
as the lower lying energy levels become occupied,

424
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:16,030
the fermions are forced by the exclusion principle

425
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:20,200
to seek out higher and higher energy levels that

426
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:23,500
remain unoccupied and therefore available to them,

427
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:24,850
which is.

428
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:31,260
The fundamental reason why atoms have electronic

429
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:34,200
structure because electrons are fermions and

430
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:38,460
rather than all filling up, all the electrons

431
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:43,380
orbiting an atomic nucleus could opt for Yori just

432
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:46,320
hanging out in the ground. States have every atom

433
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:48,930
behave the same with no such thing as chemistry,

434
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:51,000
but that Pauli exclusion principle is what

435
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:55,620
prevents that situation. Forces electrons to keep

436
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:58,350
filling out higher and higher energy levels in

437
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:02,010
atoms, which is what allows those atoms to form

438
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:08,380
molecules and. Eventually form us. So the

439
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:12,970
exclusion principle is quite useful for us to

440
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:13,650
exist.

441
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:26,570
So at this point, I will. Pause one last time

442
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:33,560
before diving into the deeper analysis of the.

443
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:39,560
Quantum statistics of gas's of those arms, the

444
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:43,570
more familiar case where. We could have as many

445
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:49,150
bosun's as we want in any given energy level, if

446
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:53,620
there are questions about. What has come up so far

447
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:54,010
today?

448
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,350
Write it down or speak them up, raise your hand

449
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:01,650
and zoom. You know.

450
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:10,630
If you just a few seconds for that before hopping

451
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:13,590
over. To recreate.

452
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:41,830
Not seeing or. Hearing anything on any screen?

453
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:48,540
We can dive into week eight again with a bit of.

454
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:55,610
Supplementary background or elaboration on the the

455
00:33:56,070 --> 00:34:01,670
module material. And in fact, I preview this a bit

456
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:06,430
earlier today when we were talking about the. The

457
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:09,090
chemical potential and the appearance of the

458
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:11,590
diversions in the.

459
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:17,290
Those Einstein distribution when the exponential

460
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:22,210
factor. Equals one when his argument vanishes.

461
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:25,690
They have that energy level equal to the chemical

462
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:30,570
potential. I can see that divergence both here in.

463
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:34,730
Dividing by one over a factor approaching zero one

464
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:39,080
minus one or taking the logarithm of factor one

465
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:43,550
minus a number, that approaches one. As its

466
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:46,190
argument goes to zero, but.

467
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:51,640
Not surprisingly, since the real world is not

468
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:55,030
divergent, everything is finite. We do not

469
00:34:55,030 --> 00:35:01,650
encounter. That issue in. Real systems, in part

470
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:05,490
because the rules of quantum mechanics require

471
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:10,710
that the energy levels in a finite volume are

472
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:15,090
non-zero. The momentum in particular do not take a

473
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:21,710
exactly varnishing zero value and. Again, at the

474
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:24,680
level of this molecule that can be taken as input,

475
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:28,220
but if you are curious about where exactly it's

476
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:33,410
coming from, there is it can be appreciated from.

477
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:37,390
A fairly famous result of quantum physics called

478
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:40,870
the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which.

479
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:48,280
States that. Well, what is called the uncertainty

480
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:49,090
or.

481
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,410
What we can really recognize, having gone through

482
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:57,470
some of the work of this module as this version of

483
00:35:57,470 --> 00:36:00,110
a particle's position and of that particular

484
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:01,760
momentum in quantum mechanics

485
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:09,060
has some minimum value, that that product there,

486
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:11,870
you can find factors of two in different

487
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:13,880
dimensions for this cell, but a little squiggly

488
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:17,120
sign in that inequality. But there is a factor of

489
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:20,180
each bar on the right hand side.

490
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:26,550
And there's also a AL-JABRI, a connection to this

491
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:31,640
that the. Position and momentum are. Don, can you

492
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:36,940
take operators in the language of of algebra's la

493
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:39,560
algebra's of the groups for those of you who have

494
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:42,710
encountered those concepts in previous modules?

495
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:45,410
And how far is the.

496
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:50,880
Is there commutator the level to which they do not

497
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,100
compete with each other, but that may be getting

498
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:56,190
too technical, even for supplementary?

499
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:02,590
Addition to to the material, what happens if we

500
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:07,150
had a momentum of exactly zero leading to an

501
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:11,290
energy of exactly zero is that the uncertainty of

502
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:13,150
the dispersion in the momentum itself would be

503
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:16,600
exactly zero. And then we would need an infinite

504
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:20,950
divergence, dispersion in the position in order

505
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:25,150
for this inequality to be satisfied. And that is

506
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:28,960
something that we cannot have in a finite volume,

507
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:34,400
such as the observable universe. So we have

508
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:38,600
non-zero energies, which is what allows us to have

509
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:43,080
the. Vanishing chemical potential.

510
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:49,520
Discussed at the end of this first section of the

511
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:51,140
is on gas, and that is.

512
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:56,680
Another significant simplification, not quite as

513
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:00,580
significant as the factorization that comes from

514
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:04,120
Don, attracting ideal particles, which is what?

515
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:09,330
Allows the overall grand canonical potential to be

516
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:12,840
written as a simple sum over all the possible

517
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:18,980
energy levels of the system. But it is still a

518
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,250
very useful and very significant simplification,

519
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:27,140
which we can see where we would see if we tried to

520
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:30,140
duck back to the.

521
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:36,130
Non relativistic or.

522
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:40,850
I should say massive exotic particles that we

523
00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:47,120
considered back in in week four, we had classical

524
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,700
particles inaudible gas in the container with

525
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:55,610
their energy of P squared. Overthe place, their

526
00:38:55,610 --> 00:38:59,750
mass, which in that finite volume, the

527
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:03,530
quantization of the moment, simply leads to this

528
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:06,190
expression for the energy that we've seen before

529
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:12,170
as an overall factor, depending on the volume and

530
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:17,220
depending on Planck's constant each for. With just

531
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:18,930
numerical factors of.

532
00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:24,790
None. Well, in the classical case, not negative,

533
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:27,490
but here in quantum mechanics, strictly positive

534
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:32,320
integers k ranging from one to up to infinity to

535
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:36,100
finding our energy levels and their degeneracy is.

536
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:43,170
And I did. Mentioned in that discussion just now,

537
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:46,440
I realize talking about relativistic and non

538
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:50,010
relativistic particles, maybe I'll wrap up the

539
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:51,750
last few minutes today by

540
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:56,640
just filling in some discussion of that. A

541
00:39:57,060 --> 00:40:00,240
reminder for those of you who have encountered

542
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:04,210
special relativity in the past and maybe a bit of,

543
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:10,230
again, interesting supplemental information for

544
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:15,490
those of you who. Or maybe seeing this for the

545
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:17,830
first time, you have some blank space at the top

546
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:23,350
of the page here where I can write down really the

547
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:28,000
most general expression for the energy of a

548
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,110
particle as a function of its momentum in special

549
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:35,890
relativity, which is the square root of that

550
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:38,830
momentum squared times, the speed of light squared,

551
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:43,120
plus the mass of the particle again squared times

552
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:46,910
the speed of light to the power. Four, to get the

553
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:51,380
universe to work out correctly. We're also

554
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:54,140
something we certainly saw in before, but I'll

555
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:59,770
remind you of here is that this undecorated P

556
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:04,190
squared for the momenta is the scalar product of

557
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:06,530
the momentum vectors.

558
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:14,020
That you have components of momentum in each

559
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:16,240
possible spatial direction, left and right,

560
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:20,050
forward and backward, up and down. So writing

561
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:23,800
things out in terms of those components, this

562
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:27,370
overall P squared that appears in the energy

563
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:32,470
momentum relation. Is just the sum of squares of

564
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:36,820
those individual momentum components in the X, Y

565
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:42,090
and Z directions. And if we consider the case of a

566
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:46,470
particle with vanishing momentum and see

567
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:51,900
immediately that its energy is the mass times, the

568
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:57,300
speed of light squared equals MC squared being the

569
00:41:57,570 --> 00:42:03,060
one of the most famous equations in the bottle in

570
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:05,480
modern physics and also in pretty modern physics.

571
00:42:06,330 --> 00:42:11,390
This describes the so-called reste energy. Of a

572
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:15,470
particle with mass M that is not moving, it has

573
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:21,280
lamented zero. And. If we take the.

574
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:26,990
Consider the opposite extreme of a particle with

575
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:31,760
mass, much less than its momentum rather than much

576
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:35,780
greater than its momentum, than the mass drops out

577
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:38,780
of this equation. And we just have the energy

578
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:43,100
equal to P the moment, sometimes the speed of

579
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:47,390
light operating effectively as a unit conversion

580
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:50,240
factor, changing from units of momentum to units

581
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:53,480
of energy. So choosing appropriate units leaves

582
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:59,330
that speed of light just equal to to one, though

583
00:42:59,330 --> 00:43:03,020
we will carry it around in.

584
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:07,700
In the materials for this module.

585
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:15,100
Just to keep track of it and as a check on some of

586
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:18,400
these familiar equations like equals EMC squared.

587
00:43:19,370 --> 00:43:25,490
And if we look at, say, intermediate regimes,

588
00:43:25,730 --> 00:43:32,320
where. Say both the momentum and mass are non-zero

589
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:35,520
zero, but the the mass is relatively large

590
00:43:36,270 --> 00:43:43,530
compared to the momentum. Then we can pull. That

591
00:43:43,530 --> 00:43:47,370
factor, EMC squared out in front of that square

592
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:53,180
root and. Changing the order of the terms would

593
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:59,240
end up with just one plus A P squared over M

594
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:05,600
squared times, C squared. From pulling out four

595
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:08,600
factors of sea out of the two that are already

596
00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:11,510
multiplying the momentum under the square roots

597
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:16,130
and expanding this to linear order in that ratio

598
00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:23,270
of P divided by it, that should call this and see.

599
00:44:29,390 --> 00:44:33,980
We get the rest energy, EMC squared plus EMC

600
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:41,130
squared times. Pia, authorities squared plus order.

601
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:50,550
Peter, the four. Over M three, C two, which. Like,

602
00:44:50,710 --> 00:44:52,300
where can I fit this in?

603
00:44:55,370 --> 00:44:59,390
That is EMC squared, the rest energy will let me

604
00:44:59,390 --> 00:45:03,530
do this, pull out just that latter term we have.

605
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:08,180
What is called the kinetic energy or energy of

606
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:12,160
motion, energy of momentum, factor of P squared,

607
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:17,370
we have M over M squared is an M i. Forgot about a

608
00:45:17,370 --> 00:45:20,100
factor of a half from the expansion of the square

609
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:23,550
root as a one half power, and there is to any and

610
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:28,140
all factors of sea cancel out, and that should be.

611
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:34,620
Exactly what we wrote down a few weeks ago. So

612
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:39,720
that is the distinction that we have between non

613
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:42,270
relativistic particles considered previously and

614
00:45:42,270 --> 00:45:47,820
the relativistic particles with. Energy of

615
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:51,210
momentum, time, speed of light, which is the case

616
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:56,910
for photons that we're focusing on this week, and

617
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:02,160
an easy way to remember this whole setup is to

618
00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:07,950
picture a triangle with the energy on the

619
00:46:07,950 --> 00:46:10,500
hypotenuse, a right triangle with.

620
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:17,390
EMC squared on one of the legs of the triangle in

621
00:46:17,390 --> 00:46:20,420
P, C on the other, which.

622
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:26,100
Doesn't have any real physical meaning as a

623
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:29,730
triangle, but it's a visual, dramatic way to

624
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:35,910
remember the. Overall relation between mass energy

625
00:46:35,910 --> 00:46:40,050
and momentum in special relativity. So.

626
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:46,550
That takes us to the end of time and I will stop

627
00:46:46,550 --> 00:46:50,720
there and dig into the actual results of the week,

628
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:56,570
eight notes on Thursday called. You're free to ask

629
00:46:56,570 --> 00:46:58,370
any immediate questions that you have right now,

630
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:02,470
but. If I don't hear those next few seconds, I

631
00:47:02,470 --> 00:47:05,620
will shut down, zoom and sort of back up again

632
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:10,180
after saving the recording for the office hours

633
00:47:11,230 --> 00:47:14,530
and then call again Thursday afternoon.
