1
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:10,820
OK, the recording should now be underway, starting

2
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:15,290
off, as usual, with just an opportunity for those

3
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:17,370
of you who are able to make it synchronously.

4
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:21,380
Still to bring up any questions you may have about

5
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,280
the materials for this week or any of the previous

6
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:33,220
weeks, and that is up and running on the. Usual

7
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:35,700
pull everywhere, link in the chat window.

8
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:44,320
Now, gotten through all of the interim assessment

9
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:50,010
for this course, I need to catch up with marching

10
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:54,130
off the computer projects and the homework

11
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:56,560
schedule on Tuesday, there is still time for

12
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:01,120
submissions or re submissions of those Tuesday

13
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,330
homeworks and then the.

14
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:11,250
Last landmark remaining for the term is the final

15
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:16,390
assessment scheduled for Tuesday, the 25th of May.

16
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:20,310
There are some sample exams and other practice

17
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,890
problems already on the campus sites and some

18
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,500
solutions to those are there as well. And more

19
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,660
will be coming as

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,290
time gets freed up from writing the. The written

21
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:38,300
materials for this. Module, as well as the

22
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:39,620
internal assessments

23
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:42,350
in the.

24
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:49,050
Other main logistical note for today is that

25
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,120
Monday is a holiday in the U.K., which means that

26
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:56,970
we will not have a secret session. Then we'll meet

27
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:02,790
again this time next Thursday. And at that time

28
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:06,390
when we meet, we will be talking about something

29
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,760
significantly different than what we've been doing

30
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,470
through the module so far. So today, if I don't

31
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:18,770
see any questions coming in on Ziu or everywhere,

32
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:23,160
so if I hop over to the materials for this week.

33
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:24,470
And.

34
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:30,230
As you look at these, you may have seen that these

35
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:32,810
are the the shortest set of notes and also the set

36
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:37,010
with the fewest exercises built in four for you to

37
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:40,990
work through. And the style of an asynchronous

38
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:44,440
tutorial, and that is largely because this is.

39
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:49,380
Really wrapping up all that we've been doing

40
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,080
through the module so far, looking at idealizes

41
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,840
systems whose constituents do not interact with

42
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,640
each other, so many of the calculations being done

43
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:04,800
here, in particular compared to the calculations

44
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,960
done last week for voting yes, guesses of photons

45
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:13,650
and bosons more generally. See, there are a great

46
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:17,250
many similarities, especially in the the

47
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,500
relativistic case considered right at the very end,

48
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:23,940
where really the only change with respect to the

49
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:30,030
photon gas is the relative negative side in the

50
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:34,950
integrals for the energy density and particle

51
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:39,780
density and particle density, which leads to a

52
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:45,490
slightly different. Numerical factor in the

53
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:50,980
equation of state that has the usual form. Same as

54
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:55,600
the ideal gas law, PV is proportional to a.. With

55
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,570
that concept of proportionality, something that.

56
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:05,230
You can work out by looking up those integrals or

57
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:10,360
plugging them into a program like. Mathematica or

58
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:17,320
over on that label, those are not very friendly

59
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,980
integrals to try to do yourself. They do have some

60
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:25,810
very nice numerical values in terms of Remon Zeta

61
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:29,290
function, similar to what we saw for photons last

62
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:37,040
week. So I'll leave that. Just generic. Hole up,

63
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,480
there is another place for you to toss in any

64
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:44,600
questions that come up again, not only about this

65
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,540
leak, but anything in the module so far. And in

66
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,550
the absence of questions, we'll just go through

67
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,620
the material for this week, trying not to repeat

68
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:58,220
the content, but build on it in some ways, also

69
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:03,960
doing a bit of review and consolidation for ideal

70
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:09,050
Agassiz of fermions in taking the quantum approach

71
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:12,590
where the partition function, in this case, the

72
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:16,690
grand canonical partition function. As a function

73
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:19,900
of temperature and chemical potential is defined

74
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:20,350
by.

75
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,560
Something over all of the energy levels, which

76
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,440
when we carry through that computation, we found

77
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,980
factories into simply a product over all of those

78
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:36,370
energy levels, thanks to the non interacting

79
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:40,870
nature of the particles in this gas. Exactly what

80
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:44,020
we're going to lose as we move on into the next

81
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:48,190
topic of molecule, looking at systems of particles

82
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:50,470
that do interact with each other and no longer

83
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:53,280
factories in this elegant way.

84
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,090
And what we need to do in order to carry out

85
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:01,420
concrete calculations with this great economical

86
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:04,310
production function and its corresponding grant

87
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:08,380
economical potential related to the Lord of that

88
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:12,700
partitioned function is specify the energy levels

89
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:16,450
for the systems of interest where. Whereas last

90
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:22,020
week we looked at so-called ultra relativistic

91
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:26,890
gases of photons where four photons that are

92
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:31,840
massless particles and their energy then does not

93
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,660
depend on the mass of the particles, but only on

94
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,800
its momentum or equivalently its frequency

95
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:42,550
interpreted as an electromagnetic wave. Here,

96
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:46,810
we'll start off by looking at. Not a relativistic

97
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:49,570
fermions, though, going back to exactly the same

98
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:53,260
form of the energy that we've considered in week

99
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:58,060
four through a classical canonical approach. Where

100
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:02,470
the energy is, the momentum squared over twice,

101
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:03,790
the particle last.

102
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:11,150
And those moments are quantized by defining the

103
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:17,650
system in a finite volume. V, which is a cubic

104
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:21,520
volume factor of L on each side of the cube, and

105
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,530
that takes this energy into an expression that

106
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:30,270
depends on three integers corresponding to

107
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:34,240
so-called quantum numbers in each of the three

108
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:38,650
dimensions of the volume with as for the photon

109
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:41,440
gas and quantum gases of bosons, the.

110
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:47,860
Sort of trivial case where all three of or or any

111
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:53,590
of those moments are zero is forbidden by. Quantum

112
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:55,270
mechanics, in particular, the Heisenberg

113
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:57,670
uncertainty principle that we discussed in

114
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:05,090
previous synchronous session. We also have to take

115
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:09,600
note of the DeGeneres's for each of these energies,

116
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:14,450
so how many? Energy levels, there are for any

117
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:18,320
given value of the energy set by these three.

118
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:26,070
Integers in this vector K like a Z, and for

119
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:31,420
typical fermions such as electrons, there are. To

120
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:36,820
energy levels for each year of the energy, and

121
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:43,420
this is the same numerical factor that we saw for

122
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:47,890
photons last week, the origin is slightly

123
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:51,040
different for photons. We had two polarizations

124
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:57,400
states, two ways in which the the photons could

125
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,980
oscillate, understood as waves with a wavelength

126
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:03,790
of frequency and for electrons. What we have is

127
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:07,420
something known as spin or intrinsic spin, which

128
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:14,230
is a quantum property of. All while, all particles,

129
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:19,000
all quantum systems where the particle in question

130
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,170
behaves as though it were spinning about an axis,

131
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:26,170
even though and this is where things get confusing

132
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:30,820
and we will go into the full physics

133
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,820
interpretation in this mathematics module,

134
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:37,060
particles are not actually spinning. They simply

135
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:41,620
carry a quantized unit of angular momentum as

136
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:44,080
though as if they were spinning.

137
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:48,850
And I'm refraining from showing you any of the

138
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:51,760
sort of illustrations of particle spin that you

139
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,510
can find, say, through a Google image search,

140
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:59,020
because those all of those I was able to find

141
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:02,710
showed particles spinning, rotating about an axis,

142
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:04,390
which is not actually the case. This is an

143
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:09,100
intrinsic property of a particle, intrinsic

144
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:12,850
angular momentum rather than something resulting

145
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:16,240
from the particle doing something or behaving in a

146
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:16,950
certain way.

147
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:26,010
But the electrons are typical examples of fermions

148
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:30,690
where there are two possible spin states, so spin

149
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:35,070
up and spin down, and mathematically this

150
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:37,770
corresponds to electrons being so-called spin half

151
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:42,240
particles where that half is a measure of how much

152
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:46,560
angular momentum each electron has as an intrinsic

153
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:52,590
property of its quantum nature. And the the

154
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:57,090
theorem that was mentioned in passing in the

155
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:02,650
materials aspect for weeks seven. Known as the

156
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:08,140
Spin Statistics Theorem. Which is linked at the

157
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:11,320
start of Section seven point two to that Wikipedia

158
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:11,920
article.

159
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:17,820
Is one of the the deep results in quantum physics

160
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:23,970
from the 20th century. Which established that well

161
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:29,640
was the place in this set of notes established

162
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:33,390
that in three spatial dimensions there are only

163
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:37,380
two possibilities for the behavior of particles,

164
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,780
the bosons and fermions that we've been

165
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:44,140
considering where. Those boats are they confirm

166
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:48,970
your statistics are related to the spin of the

167
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:53,260
particle and the spin statistics theorem where all

168
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:55,780
the bosons have integer.

169
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:04,690
Values of spin in this particular basis that

170
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:08,320
depends on success at each bar and fermions have

171
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,880
half integer values of of the spin and the total

172
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:17,560
amount of degeneracy. That there is for.

173
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:24,170
Each of these. Different spins, if so free.

174
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:30,610
Find that spin to be a quantity called s, the

175
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:37,340
total degeneracy is two times as. Plus one, so

176
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:41,210
it's been zero particle with zero has only one

177
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:45,140
state per energy level, the Higgs boson is a

178
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,450
famous example of that. Since being a half

179
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:51,410
electrons a few times a half is one plus one or

180
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:54,590
two of these states. So in going up to speed,

181
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:57,890
three have speed at four and spend five hands.

182
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:01,940
Gives us six.

183
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:09,930
And so, again, a double degeneracy, so even the

184
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:13,800
three factors in some of the expressions here we

185
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,290
have when we go through the same change are

186
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:21,360
variables. To convert the grand canonical

187
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:27,220
potential into a control over these.

188
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,340
The three momentum vectors or the movement of

189
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:37,510
three vector of the particles in this from Yungas,

190
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:42,290
even the pre factor comes out the same as the was

191
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,940
on a case last week, just by coincidence, with

192
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:49,390
that factor of two four spin states versus factor

193
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:54,180
of two for polarization states. And in the same

194
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:57,770
spirit as. What we set up for the folks on

195
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:01,400
integrating were expressing things like the

196
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,010
particle, no density in the energy density as

197
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:10,100
integrals over the photon frequency, which was

198
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:13,490
just related to its energy. Will do that same sort

199
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:16,880
of thing only in this non relativistic case where

200
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:24,060
we have. These. Momenta key squared related to

201
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:28,180
that. P squared, divided by twice the critical

202
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:31,250
mass, you'll integrate a set of over frequency and

203
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:36,910
over the energies themselves. Which brings in some

204
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:42,250
factors of a square root when we essentially

205
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:45,750
inverted the energy moments in relation to express

206
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:52,150
the momentum as a function of the energy and then

207
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:56,070
with. The grand canonical potential expressed in

208
00:14:56,070 --> 00:15:00,930
this way, an integral of a particular function

209
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:04,110
over energies we can.

210
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:09,820
Investigate that function as to the fundamental

211
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:14,920
underlying mathematical aspects of the ferry gas

212
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:18,220
in much the same way that the Planck distribution

213
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:23,020
was the fundamental underlying quantity for the

214
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:27,070
photon gas. One thing we'll do differently is keep

215
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:31,930
the second separate factors separate from the

216
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:33,340
so-called FERME function.

217
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:40,810
Which is just a convention that allows. US to

218
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:44,530
recognize the the ferry function as essentially

219
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:48,740
the the same thing we saw. A couple of weeks ago

220
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:53,240
when looking at average occupation numbers where.

221
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,370
The average occupation number that we computed

222
00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:02,690
back in the big seven for fermions. As opposed to

223
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:08,620
boatswain's. And precisely the form we are looking

224
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:12,790
at here, the difference being that instead of now

225
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:17,860
fixing a value of the energy corresponding to the

226
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:21,790
particular energy level whose occupation number we

227
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:24,970
were considering back then, we're now looking at

228
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:30,240
this expression as a function of the energy. And

229
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:32,730
in particular, integrating over those energies and

230
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:35,010
expressions for things like the particle, no

231
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:35,550
density.

232
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:43,350
As functions of the inverse temperature data and

233
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:48,160
chemical potential, mbewe, so. For particular

234
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,420
values of temperature and chemical potential, we

235
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:56,680
want to see how this very function evolves as we

236
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:00,820
go from one energy level to the next, simplifying

237
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:04,510
the calculations by making the usual approximation

238
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:07,240
of the energy levels are sufficiently closely

239
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,790
space that we can integrate over them rather than

240
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:15,140
having to deal with Plunky Sum's. And we will also

241
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:18,770
be focusing on the low temperature regime, where,

242
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:23,810
despite having the same relation between energy

243
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:29,150
and implementor as the classical ideal gas that we

244
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:33,490
looked at. I can read the canonical ensemble, the

245
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:35,620
quantum effects of.

246
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,970
Of these FIRREA, of these quantum fermions will be

247
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:44,480
most readily apparent at low energies, and in

248
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,890
particular even in the limit where the energy goes

249
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:54,200
to zero, we will. Simplify things in much the same

250
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:58,820
way that we simplified the photographs last week

251
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:03,830
by recognizing that it was best described by a

252
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,100
chemical potential of zero. So here the chemical

253
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:10,010
potential remains in the calculations.

254
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:16,630
And it is in particular a positive number, as we

255
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:21,580
will see shortly, what we're going to be focusing

256
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:26,200
on is the low temperature limits of teh.

257
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:31,740
Approaching zero and the behavior of this family

258
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:38,370
function that appears in the integration of all of

259
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:41,670
the expressions we're going to be computing for

260
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:45,120
things like particle no density and energy density

261
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:49,440
to determine the low temperature equation of state

262
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,300
and.

263
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:56,400
What's going on in this plot is we are plotting

264
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,830
things on the horizontal axis against a

265
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:02,790
dimensionless combination of the energy level and

266
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:07,280
chemical potential. For several different values

267
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,030
of the dimensionless ratio of the temperature to

268
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:12,140
that chemical potential.

269
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:16,810
And as.

270
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:22,910
That ratio of the temperature relative to the

271
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:26,000
chemical potential decrease is going to lower

272
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,790
temperatures. We can see that.

273
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:35,270
The ferry function gets closer and closer to a

274
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,630
step function that is that is one for all values

275
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:43,680
of the energy less than the chemical potential and.

276
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:47,730
Zero for all values of the energy greater than the

277
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:52,150
chemical potential. At higher energies, the

278
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:55,960
evolution from between those two limits, which we

279
00:19:56,410 --> 00:20:00,910
saw as the extremes that fermions could possibly

280
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:05,880
exhibit, when there can be at most one fermions

281
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:06,880
her energy level.

282
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:12,400
At high temperatures, there is on average very few

283
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,970
and approaching zero particles and his energy

284
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:18,250
level. There are many more energy levels. There

285
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:21,730
are particles and low density risk for low

286
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:24,640
energies. It's the opposite situation. There are

287
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,450
relatively large number of particles that are

288
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:33,670
steadily filling all of the available low energy

289
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,490
or all of the available energy levels with low

290
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:40,370
energies. So there's qualitatively different

291
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:44,360
behavior as the temperature decreases, depending

292
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:44,750
on.

293
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:51,170
Whether the energy is larger then or smaller than.

294
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:56,730
The chemical potential. When it's larger, the

295
00:20:57,150 --> 00:21:01,710
family function decreases as the temperature

296
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:05,610
decreases, going to zero on that side of the step

297
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:10,960
function and conversely for lower energies. Lower

298
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,760
temperatures produce a larger and increasing value

299
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,280
of the family function approaching that.

300
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,060
The maximum value of one.

301
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:25,180
And.

302
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:30,320
The points where the energy equals the chemical

303
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:35,120
potential is the special point where the primary

304
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,450
function is always a half and it's the point where.

305
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,360
The step function that we can use as an

306
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:46,290
approximation to the family function transitions

307
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:50,430
from zero to one, which, as I started to say

308
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:53,700
earlier, is a change from all the energy levels

309
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:59,970
being occupied by the single Fermoy on that. That

310
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:04,140
they allow at low energies to all of those energy

311
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:07,950
levels being unoccupied at higher energies

312
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:10,860
and.

313
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:15,140
Now, this approximation of the step function is

314
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:19,100
exact in the zero temperature limit, what we're

315
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:22,310
used to thinking about as absolute zero where?

316
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:28,150
Previously, we've seen the all energy in motion of

317
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:31,660
systems coming to a halt at absolute zero. We'll

318
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:34,810
see that the public exclusion principle that.

319
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:40,790
Forbids multiple electrons from multiple fermions

320
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:44,210
from occupying the same energy level will lead to

321
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:45,770
different behavior.

322
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:51,850
In the zero temperature limit for these quantum

323
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:56,290
gases of fermions before we get there.

324
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:05,470
There are some quick calculations to do which. Of.

325
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:07,850
Echo, what was.

326
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:16,250
Done in previous weeks, especially for the folks

327
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:18,740
on gas computing, the.

328
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:28,710
Particle, no density where if we plug in the step

329
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:32,670
function for the family function, what we have is

330
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:37,050
a one for all energies from zero up to HMU. So all

331
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:41,430
that's left is the square root of E e and then

332
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:43,800
that very function is just zero for all higher

333
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:48,150
energies. So that is the total expression,

334
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:54,840
constant factor coming along out front. And then

335
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:59,730
the integral of it is the power, one half is the

336
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:03,760
power three hands and evaluated that new. And then

337
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:08,050
zero and divided by that power, so rearranging

338
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:13,700
things just gives three factors of two. Three

339
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:17,750
factors and three factors of. You.

340
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:25,850
Well, with that square root, so to add new to the

341
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:29,780
three has power and then a three pi square each

342
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:35,800
bar cube where? The two notable aspects of this

343
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:40,620
result are. The dependence on Muta, the three

344
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:43,560
haves, and the independence on the temperature. So

345
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:46,260
this is both of these we can

346
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:54,540
justify or anticipate based on sort of simple

347
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:58,350
arguments going back to even the setup of the

348
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:02,490
problem, expressing everything as an integral.

349
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,360
Over the energies where those energies are.

350
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:14,290
Related to the squares of the momenta.

351
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:20,760
So integrating over the entities is equivalent to

352
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:27,300
integrating over some portion of the sphere in the

353
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:34,560
space of these three Momenta K, K, Y and Z. And

354
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:37,830
the radius of that sphere in this approximation

355
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:43,290
where the sphere is cut off at this particular

356
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:46,860
value, where the energy equals the chemical

357
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:50,340
potential new, we have a hard sphere with a radius

358
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:55,230
of you sorry, the radius is the square root of you

359
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:59,370
since we're integrating over energies. And then

360
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,270
the volume coming from that integral is three

361
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:06,420
factors of that square root of the radius of

362
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,550
square root of MU as the radius.

363
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:14,410
And the independence of tea is even simpler to

364
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:18,550
appreciate, just as I said, this very function

365
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:22,570
becomes exactly the step function in the limit of

366
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:26,470
absolute zero temperature. And that is essentially

367
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:30,470
what we are considering here, the. The zero

368
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:34,970
temperature limit of a Fairbury gas, which can be.

369
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:42,590
Explicitly corrected by. What's called a

370
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:46,070
Somerfield expansion, which brings in

371
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:49,970
systematically higher powers of the temperature

372
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:56,380
tea in the kind of systematic. Expansion in a

373
00:26:56,380 --> 00:27:00,010
small parameter that you got some practice with on

374
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:05,860
the homework assignment and to elaborate a little

375
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:12,010
bit on. What was included in the official

376
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:16,460
materials for this week is to. Spice up the

377
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:20,210
synchronous session by supplementing some of the.

378
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:23,770
Notified asynchronous materials.

379
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:30,030
If we yeah, a couple of things to say about the

380
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:33,930
Somerfield expansion, first of all, the integrals

381
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:38,280
that pop up as we go to higher powers of the

382
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:42,240
temperature in that expansion are very tricky ones,

383
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:46,320
which is the main reason we're not trying to to go

384
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:52,430
through that whole. Calculation in the official

385
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:57,290
asynchronous materials, it would be really as much

386
00:27:57,290 --> 00:27:59,900
material as we've had on quantum gases of both

387
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:04,530
those sounds and fermions all over again. One

388
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:05,820
thing we can do

389
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:12,910
a bit quickly, just by. The sort of physicist's

390
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:18,680
style argument based on. How this ferry function

391
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:24,880
approaches its. The step function limit in the. In

392
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:29,140
the limit of zero temperatures, we can do a

393
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,690
qualitative argument that can provide at least the

394
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:39,730
functional form of the the first. Correction in

395
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:43,850
the summer field expansion to. These quantities,

396
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:48,800
like the particle, no density and energy density

397
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:51,140
and therefore the heat capacity.

398
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:53,890
Where?

399
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:59,260
We can recognize that if we start in the zero

400
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:02,290
temperature limit, that is exactly a step function.

401
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,330
We can use that black line as a decent

402
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:08,930
approximation to that, then when the temperature

403
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:11,810
is turned on just a little bit and we have a small

404
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:15,380
value of the temperature, we still have all of the

405
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:19,790
states or all of the energy levels below this

406
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:24,370
chemical potential new being filled. But the

407
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:29,080
temperature is providing some extra energy to the

408
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:33,070
particles that can increase their probability to

409
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:36,560
occupy a an energy level with a higher energy. We

410
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:40,450
looked at that in some detail in the canonical

411
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:43,660
example in week three. Now, seeing that excited

412
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:46,570
states are exponentially suppressed in the

413
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:51,040
temperature and in the energy gap, and in this

414
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:54,160
context, the first excited states that can be

415
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:58,830
filled and are not filled already are those. Down

416
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:02,580
here, just where the energy is just above that

417
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:06,480
chemical potential, the ratio of Ammu is just

418
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:13,610
larger than. They one. And the the particles that

419
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:17,030
are most likely to be able to.

420
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:23,730
Take advantage of the extra energy from the

421
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:28,230
non-zero temperature to make the leap from a field

422
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:31,620
energy level at lower temperature up into that

423
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:36,600
unoccupied, that open energy level and a higher

424
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:40,230
energy are those that are already at the energy

425
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:44,570
levels, just below the chemical potentials of

426
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:50,000
values of the ovum. You just smaller than one. And

427
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:56,690
the. So the story that you can take away in the

428
00:30:56,690 --> 00:31:00,350
physicist's, qualitative or conceptual argument is

429
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:02,180
that the.

430
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:10,490
The distance in energy that these particles are

431
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:11,300
going to be.

432
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:16,550
These particles, energy is going to be increasing

433
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:21,380
as they move from the filled energy levels just

434
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:26,540
below UV equals one to the unoccupied energy

435
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:32,810
levels just above UV equals one, that extra energy

436
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:36,200
is going to be proportional to the temperature. So

437
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,470
the higher the temperature gets, the greater the

438
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:41,780
probability is for.

439
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:47,800
Energy levels to be occupied at higher energies

440
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:54,250
above this cutoff and at the same time, the number

441
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:58,150
of fermions that are going to be in a position to

442
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,990
move to higher energies and occupy those higher

443
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:04,330
energy for those energy levels with higher

444
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:08,560
energies are precisely the relatively few that are

445
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:13,420
hanging out just below the cutoff of the step

446
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:13,930
function.

447
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:24,200
In this region of colored in here, which also is a

448
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:28,550
number of particles that is going to grow

449
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:34,370
proportional to any growth in the temperature, so

450
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:38,000
as the temperature increases from zero, we have

451
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,090
two factors of the temperature showing up in.

452
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:48,080
In the energy that the system is going to have one

453
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:53,950
coming from the. Change in the energy levels with.

454
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,990
Or the accessible energy levels with a non

455
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:03,600
negligible probability of being occupied in the

456
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,660
second from the number of particles that are

457
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:11,450
available to occupy those energy levels. So if we

458
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:17,830
go back to where we were. Which was computing the.

459
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,590
Average energy density

460
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:28,230
following on almost the same calculation as the

461
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:31,490
the number of density, all that has changed is.

462
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:36,590
Adding a factor of the energy to the integration,

463
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:39,510
so integrating the energy over this probability

464
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:40,290
distribution.

465
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:45,850
We can skip rewriting the integral with its cut

466
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:49,630
off from zero to Mew for putting in the step

467
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:54,440
function. And jump straight to what is.

468
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:03,030
A very similar result is just. Five have a of new

469
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:10,910
and divided by that power. Which can rearrange as

470
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:17,480
that same. Factor of two and the three has now

471
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:24,110
divided by five. I swear it started with one hour

472
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:29,570
of HMU left over. And because these are the same

473
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:34,550
factors and they're high in each bar, we can just.

474
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:41,460
Replace them with the particle no density computed

475
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:47,670
above. And. Converting the one third in the

476
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:50,550
particle, no density to the one 5th that shows up

477
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:51,570
in the energy density.

478
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:59,020
So this is the zero temperature leading result of

479
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:01,520
this summer felt expansion for the energy density

480
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:08,610
and if you were able to grind through. The

481
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:11,820
calculation there to close.

482
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:18,510
Which is done in. Schroeder's textbook, at least,

483
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:20,730
and possibly David Tauxe lecture notes some of the

484
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:23,670
references at the start of the materials for this

485
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:28,140
course, we do indeed find that the next connection

486
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:32,010
or next correction to. The.

487
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:40,790
Energy density from Somerfield expansion is

488
00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:45,830
proportional to T squared, as promised and is a

489
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:49,760
factor of new. Coming in the denominator to get

490
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:55,050
the units to work out correctly and then. We're

491
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:58,030
we're to the fourth is the next correction in that

492
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:58,690
series.

493
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,180
So.

494
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,320
I'm looking at the time and realizing that, as

495
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,860
usual, the supplemental discussion about Zemmour

496
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:20,800
failed expansion and the complications that arise

497
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:26,790
took took longer than. I expected also just

498
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:31,230
quickly mention that some of this results here.

499
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:38,640
If the screen behaves itself and underlines, it is.

500
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:43,810
Where we can determine the huge capacity of the

501
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:48,200
firm Yungas. That low energy of.

502
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,520
Derivative of the energy with respect to

503
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:59,450
temperature at fixed volume. So the first term

504
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:03,960
that we had here. Would have just predicted a a

505
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,520
completely vanishing heat capacity, which we saw

506
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:09,070
earlier in the course of this evening, the

507
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:12,540
homework is the very unusual situation that we

508
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:15,310
generally only have in the limit of zero

509
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:21,820
temperature or infinite temperature. And it is the.

510
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:26,300
Correction coming from the term in the Somerfield

511
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:29,640
expansion. That gives.

512
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:37,110
The. True heat capacity of the low temperature

513
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:43,560
firmly on gas is taking a derivative. Of T squared,

514
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:45,870
bringing down a factor of two.

515
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:51,330
And actually, there's no V there, because he

516
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:55,560
capacity is the derivative of the energy rather

517
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:58,230
than the energy density, and the energy itself is

518
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:02,430
one of those extensive quantities that scales with

519
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:03,840
the total volume.

520
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:10,900
And the pressure is at this point, just as easy to

521
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:14,260
compute as the heat capacity, again in this zero

522
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:20,290
temperature limit where the entropy. Is is zero

523
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:26,860
and brings in that same sort of there is a zero

524
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:29,710
field expansion for the entropy at non-zero

525
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:32,920
temperatures. So this equation of state that we

526
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:37,320
have here. Expressed in sort of three different

527
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:44,220
ways. That the pressure is. Related to the

528
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:46,130
chemical potential times, the number of destiny or

529
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:52,030
currently the energy density, or if we. Substitute

530
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:56,770
in this chemical potential, we end up with the

531
00:38:56,770 --> 00:39:00,460
five thirds power of the particle, no density

532
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:10,360
and divided by the volume. This is really the zero

533
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:16,240
temperature result, which, in contrast to both the

534
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:19,630
boson, the quantum boson gas equation of state and

535
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:22,720
the classical equation of state, the ideal gas law,

536
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:28,780
the equals a.. This pressure does not vanish at.

537
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,270
Had zero temperature.

538
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:43,550
And. I think I. Glossed over one thing up here,

539
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:46,100
which is the the definition of the family energy,

540
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:49,730
just as this zero temperature chemical potential

541
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:51,230
of.

542
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:58,450
This is that relation between the zero temperature,

543
00:39:58,450 --> 00:40:01,240
chemical potential and particle no density that

544
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:04,090
goes into the pressure to give that functional

545
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:07,810
dependence the power of the five thirds power.

546
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:12,250
Where if we invert this equation and again,

547
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:20,390
consider. Corrections coming. To it from. The.

548
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:28,820
There's no field expansion we have. The feminine

549
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:32,390
energy, just as the zero temperature limit of the

550
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:36,680
chemical potential where those higher. Order

551
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,720
corrections in the temperature vanish.

552
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:46,000
And this is a plot of.

553
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:48,920
The.

554
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:54,960
The pressure of the family gas compared to the

555
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:59,220
temperature, which we can contrast to the ideal

556
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:03,270
gas law for classical particles, which is just PV,

557
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:06,450
equals A..

558
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:15,770
Where he is in a river times tea, which is the

559
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:19,310
density road we define, so that corresponds to

560
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:26,730
just a straight line with slope ro. That the

561
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:30,750
Fermoy gas approaches at high temperatures we have

562
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:36,890
seen. But the non-zero value in the the

563
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:40,550
temperature limits and even at low temperatures

564
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:44,510
before the classical physics becomes a good

565
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:45,440
approximation.

566
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:53,630
Is really a remarkable mathematical prediction

567
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:59,450
that is borne out again in real physical systems

568
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:00,920
in the universe, including.

569
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:11,660
Some of the. Densest stars in the universe, which

570
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:14,720
which are the setting for a particular type of

571
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:20,830
supernova known as Type 1A for. Obscure historical

572
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:27,360
reasons. And what goes on in this setting is that

573
00:42:28,290 --> 00:42:32,220
these stars, either neutron stars or white dwarf

574
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:33,240
stars, tend to be.

575
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:38,210
Quite old. They've been around since the early

576
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:41,120
days of the universe billions of years ago, and

577
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:41,720
they are.

578
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:47,660
Because they are so old, they have actually burned

579
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:51,650
through nuclear fusion, all of the light elements,

580
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:56,450
all of the fuel that is generating heat and lights

581
00:42:56,450 --> 00:42:59,990
in the stars that we can see in the sky, including

582
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:05,560
our own sun. The the white dwarfs no longer have

583
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:11,110
that nuclear fusion process, giving them lots of

584
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:14,620
heat, lots of energy and lots of the corresponding

585
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:18,040
radiation pressure that we derived last week. The

586
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:21,280
only thing keeping them from collapsing into a

587
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:24,430
black hole under the weight of all the matter they

588
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:24,970
contain.

589
00:43:27,490 --> 00:43:34,210
Which is roughly as much mass as our son. In

590
00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:38,950
something like 100000 or 100000 times smaller

591
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:40,180
volume than the sun.

592
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:52,110
What that. The only thing a. Stabilizing the white

593
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:56,200
at that volume, roughly the volume of the Earth,

594
00:43:56,210 --> 00:43:59,090
one hundred thousand times smaller than the sun is

595
00:43:59,090 --> 00:44:04,730
precisely the degeneracy pressure of there of the

596
00:44:04,730 --> 00:44:08,600
electrons in this white dwarf star understood as

597
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:11,990
an approximately zero temperature Fairbury gas,

598
00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:15,020
even though the temperature of 10 million Kelvin

599
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:20,060
is not zero by every day standards, but still very

600
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:25,400
small compared to the chemical potential, the

601
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:30,500
Fermi energy that is so large due to the very

602
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:35,870
large particle density. So something like.

603
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:45,270
Failure of row. In round numbers is ten to the

604
00:44:45,270 --> 00:44:52,410
power. Thirty six particles per cubic meter, which.

605
00:44:53,830 --> 00:44:57,520
We can compare to sort of everyday substances like

606
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:02,500
metals that have densities of around 10 of the

607
00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:08,380
eight particles per cubic meter, which is

608
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:14,810
corresponds to. That free energy of about 24

609
00:45:15,710 --> 00:45:21,230
Kelvin, just to the plugging in the massive

610
00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:24,520
electron and converting units appropriately to get

611
00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:25,040
Kelvin.

612
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:33,270
And the connection to the supernovas comes when

613
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:37,170
these white dwarf stars being supported by their

614
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:41,220
Fermi degeneracy pressure are in a binary system

615
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:44,700
as pictured in this illustration from the European

616
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:47,850
Space Agency and the white dwarf star.

617
00:45:49,870 --> 00:45:55,990
Is able to pull in or severely accretes matter and

618
00:45:55,990 --> 00:45:59,440
energy from its companion star that is still

619
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,350
burning, still undergoing nuclear fusion and

620
00:46:02,350 --> 00:46:10,340
emitting a steady stream. Of of matter that it's

621
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:13,490
caught in the gravitational attraction of the

622
00:46:13,490 --> 00:46:16,820
white dwarf star, so there's a steady accumulation

623
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:22,580
of mass in the way to Earth being balanced by its

624
00:46:24,170 --> 00:46:25,730
approximately zero temperature.

625
00:46:28,130 --> 00:46:34,860
Fermi pressure. And as more and more mass piles up,

626
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:37,380
there's more and more gravitational attraction.

627
00:46:38,950 --> 00:46:41,620
Within the white Forestar itself, leading to

628
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:45,280
higher and higher densities. And eventually

629
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:48,280
reaching through a complicated calculation, a

630
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:52,420
limiting value where the density is large enough

631
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:56,590
for new types of fusion to start occurring

632
00:46:56,590 --> 00:46:59,500
involving heavier elements, carbon and oxygen,

633
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:04,600
rather than hydrogen and helium. Which take off in

634
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:08,950
a runaway chain reaction and in the space of just

635
00:47:08,950 --> 00:47:14,860
a few seconds, basically fuse all of the carbon

636
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:19,480
atoms in the star. So about as much matter as our

637
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:25,590
own sun. An amount of energy released from those

638
00:47:25,590 --> 00:47:28,080
fusion reactions, that's about five billion times

639
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:30,950
brighter than what our sun is putting out.

640
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:37,590
And we looked a bit at the relativistic ideal from

641
00:47:37,590 --> 00:47:40,590
your guess at the start today. So I'll just

642
00:47:40,590 --> 00:47:41,100
mention.

643
00:47:43,850 --> 00:47:47,290
Just to wrap up, because we are at at the time,

644
00:47:47,570 --> 00:47:52,040
the end of time. The connection to a relatively

645
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:57,560
recent Nobel Prize for 10 years ago, what did rely

646
00:47:57,560 --> 00:48:03,710
on this process and on the the fair refresher in

647
00:48:03,710 --> 00:48:06,710
these systems of Whitemoor of stars producing Type

648
00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:13,160
1A supernovas? And that is because of this steady

649
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:18,710
accumulation of mass that the Fermi pressure

650
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:23,390
allows to occur, which means that these Type 1A

651
00:48:23,390 --> 00:48:26,750
supernovas are all very irregular, no matter what

652
00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:30,050
the white dwarfs are started out with in its its

653
00:48:30,050 --> 00:48:32,090
past life before it finished burning all of its

654
00:48:32,090 --> 00:48:35,330
fuel. What what amount of mass and what chemical

655
00:48:35,330 --> 00:48:36,410
composition it had.

656
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:42,930
It will only reach the chandrasekar limit and

657
00:48:42,930 --> 00:48:46,110
undergo this type of a supernova when it has

658
00:48:46,110 --> 00:48:49,440
accumulated precisely enough matter from its

659
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:53,760
companion star to reach that limit. So the Type 1A

660
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:58,310
supernova is very regular, both in its brightness,

661
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:02,070
how much energy it puts out and also its

662
00:49:02,070 --> 00:49:05,610
temperature, the temperature that goes into the

663
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:09,210
Planck distribution of the light from that

664
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:15,790
explosion that we can observe. And from the that

665
00:49:15,790 --> 00:49:20,440
distribution is possible to infer both how far

666
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:24,850
away the supernova was and also from the shift in

667
00:49:24,850 --> 00:49:29,140
the Planck distribution, how quickly the white

668
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:33,310
dwarf star was moving away from us at the time of

669
00:49:33,310 --> 00:49:37,940
its supernova. So because the universe is

670
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:42,590
expanding, all galaxies are moving away from each

671
00:49:42,590 --> 00:49:45,410
other in the speed at which they move away from

672
00:49:45,410 --> 00:49:48,440
each other is governed by the speed of the

673
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:50,480
universe's expansion. So by carefully

674
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:54,230
investigating Type 1A supernovas, where we could

675
00:49:54,230 --> 00:49:58,100
tell both how quickly the galaxy containing the

676
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:01,310
supernova was moving away from us and also how far

677
00:50:01,310 --> 00:50:03,650
away it was based on the brightness of the

678
00:50:03,650 --> 00:50:08,360
supernova. We were able to establish that the

679
00:50:08,870 --> 00:50:11,420
universe is actually expanding more and more

680
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:15,140
rapidly as time goes on, which is a phenomenal

681
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:21,190
they got named a dark energy. Which is. The

682
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:23,700
question will name, because it's not really dark

683
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:26,700
and it's not really energy, it's a universe

684
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:30,750
expanding faster and faster over time for as yet

685
00:50:31,170 --> 00:50:36,210
completely unknown reasons. So sorry to to run

686
00:50:36,210 --> 00:50:39,330
over time to tell that story and that connection

687
00:50:39,330 --> 00:50:46,440
to a recent physics breakthrough. I realized as I

688
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:50,020
want to take any questions and be back in. Five or

689
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:53,680
so minutes for the office hours. That's it for me

690
00:50:54,070 --> 00:50:54,700
for today.

691
00:51:00,510 --> 00:51:01,050
Thank you.
