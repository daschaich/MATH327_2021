00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:05,980
Hello and welcome back to Statistical Physics.

2
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:11,210
This is the wrap up video for week three of the

3
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:14,180
canonical ensemble, about 10 minutes summarizing

4
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:19,160
the highlights and key learning outcomes from what

5
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,880
is just the first of three weeks focused on the

6
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,510
canonical ensemble. So the key for this week is to

7
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:30,170
introduce this concept, see how it works, how it

8
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:34,040
works, how it's put together, and do a first quick

9
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:38,030
application to the physics of information. So

10
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,790
beginning from the beginning.

11
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:47,020
The overview video mentioned that the canonical

12
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:51,730
ensemble fixes the temperature and particle no, in

13
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:55,450
contrast to the micro canonical ensemble that

14
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:57,550
fixes the energy

15
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:05,090
in particle, no. So. In a lot of more physics

16
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:08,060
courses, that would sort of be the stopping point,

17
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:11,000
you would just define that as the ensemble and go

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,400
from there. Here we are being a bit more

19
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,090
mathematical and going to provide some of the

20
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:18,890
mathematical justification

21
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:25,190
attributed to Gibs that really justifies how and

22
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:27,650
why we are able to.

23
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:33,820
Use the canonical ensemble as a basis of of

24
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:38,780
analyzing statistical systems when we don't have

25
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:43,950
the. Very clear, direct connection to the

26
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,290
conservation of energy. The first law of

27
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:52,500
thermodynamics and the trick here is known as the

28
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,830
replica trick. It is a trick that we will see

29
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:59,640
again later in this module and also has other uses

30
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,230
and applications in.

31
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:08,440
In mathematical physics, and the idea is so

32
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:12,280
backtracking just a bit to reiterate the overview

33
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:17,860
in the canonical ensemble, we posit that the

34
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:21,250
temperature of our system of interest is fixed.

35
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:25,810
And we argue that this is done by having our

36
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:29,200
system in thermal contact with a much larger

37
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:33,190
external system, a thermal reservoir with which it

38
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:37,970
is able to exchange energy. And that thermal

39
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:42,560
reservoir fixes the temperature of the overall

40
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:46,460
combined system of the system we're interested in,

41
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,580
plus the reservoir is the total system that

42
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:53,570
temperature is fixed by the reservoir or the

43
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:55,610
system we're interested in is just a small

44
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:58,820
probation on that. And because the temperature is

45
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:04,340
a is an intensive quantity at fixed temperature of

46
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:07,010
the total system, including the reservoir is

47
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:10,220
picked up by the system we care about. That's the

48
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,550
handwaving, qualitative idea. And the replica

49
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:18,110
trick is a way to justify that mathematically. And

50
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:22,430
the. The overall calculation that we go through is

51
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,060
close to half of the lecture notes for this week,

52
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:28,070
though, there are

53
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,020
other pieces that we pick up along the way,

54
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,500
including the partition function and Boltzmann

55
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:40,240
distribution, that we'll get to adjust to bits.

56
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:46,400
But the basic idea is to introduce some well

57
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,600
motivated onslaughts for the form of this thermal

58
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,900
reservoir. And having specified that, we are able

59
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:59,030
to analyse it mathematically and we want to see

60
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:04,550
and do see that the detailed form of this

61
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:08,000
reservoir that we have proposed the results turns

62
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,210
out not to have any effect. All the details of the

63
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:14,750
reservoir drop out when we look at the system

64
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:18,590
itself, apart from the fact that the temperature

65
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:22,100
is fixed from having this reservoir there. So the

66
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:26,960
conclusion we draw from that, which is not a not

67
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,980
so much a proof as a self consistency argument,

68
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,560
it's saying that we don't have to worry about what

69
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,640
form this thermal reservoir has so long as it is

70
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:41,540
there. It will serve this role of fixing the

71
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:44,570
temperature and mathematically defining the

72
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:49,210
economical ensemble. And the well motivated Aitzaz

73
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:54,180
that. That gives came up with is to say, let's

74
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:58,590
just say we have a system that we want to analyze

75
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,990
with a fixed temperature and the canonical

76
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:05,430
approach, we say that while the system is

77
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:09,270
something that is realistic enough and interesting

78
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:11,820
enough that we are bothering to analyze it. So

79
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,910
let's just suppose that the thermal reservoir is

80
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:18,270
the same sort of stuff as the system, just more of

81
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:22,790
it. So we. And we formalized this by saying that

82
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:26,900
the total system is a large number of replicas,

83
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,070
identical copies of the system we are interested

84
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:35,510
in, so we can pick out one of those replicas as

85
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:40,160
the system we want to find out about in all of the

86
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,720
other replicas for collectively that large

87
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,920
external thermal reservoir that we can then

88
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:54,470
analyze by having specified how this reservoir

89
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:58,910
behaves, what it looks like in terms of the system

90
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:00,590
we are interested in studying

91
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:08,810
and. The way we analyze that overall combined

92
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:13,220
system in the replica trick is to step back to

93
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:16,490
that more fundamental micro canonical ensemble

94
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:22,960
that we spent last week looking at and. We have

95
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,710
the idea that this overall total system with all

96
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:29,860
the replicas really is the universe that matters.

97
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:33,360
So we can analyze that with the micro economical

98
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:37,750
approach that assumes conservation of energy, that

99
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:40,960
is satisfied by the overall system, even though

100
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,740
it's not satisfied by the small subsystem. The one

101
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:47,350
particular replica that we want to analyze that is

102
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:50,680
now able to exchange energy with this thermal

103
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:57,330
reservoir and applying. The microeconomic analysis

104
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:01,050
to that overall system of all of these replicas

105
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:08,080
takes us through the. Well, the same exercise as

106
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,480
it was last week, we count the number of

107
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:14,860
microstates we throughout all of this work, we are

108
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:17,710
assuming thermodynamic equilibrium. I neglected to

109
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:19,570
mention that in the overview. So I'll mention it

110
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:23,290
here. Everything is a dynamic equilibrium. So the

111
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:26,290
entropy is the logarithm of the number of

112
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:31,870
microstates. And by maximizing that subject to the

113
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:35,620
usual constraints on conservation of energy and

114
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:39,670
conservation of probability, we come up with a

115
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:46,650
form for the occupation probability. That is the

116
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:51,210
probability that if we pick any one of these

117
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:55,170
replicas at random, it will be in a particular

118
00:07:55,170 --> 00:08:00,330
micro state of the small or smaller system that we

119
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:05,500
are interested in analyzing. In the form of this

120
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:09,950
occupation, probability is. A very famous

121
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:13,940
distribution known as either the both the

122
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,700
distribution or the Gibbs distribution, depending

123
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,570
in part on which side of the Atlantic you're on

124
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,770
and it involves.

125
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:27,620
Two pieces, one of which is an exponential factor

126
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:35,540
to the. Minus energy over temperature. I'm jumping

127
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:38,090
ahead a bit to connect this to the temperature.

128
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,600
That is known as The Ballston Factor, this

129
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,730
exponential dependence, and what it tells us is

130
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:49,980
that lower energies that have a less negative

131
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,770
argument to this exponential are probabilistically

132
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:55,860
favored in the canonical approach into a dynamic

133
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:59,390
equilibrium, which is a big contrast to the

134
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,100
microeconomic ensemble where all of the

135
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:06,720
microstates had the same probability. Now we have

136
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,960
the additional specification that all microstates

137
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:14,790
with the same energy have. The same probability

138
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:20,040
and the extent to which we are sensitive to the

139
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,440
energy is set by the temperature that is

140
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,040
normalizing this. The other piece of the

141
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:31,140
distribution is the partition function Z, which is

142
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:36,660
the sum over all microstates of our single replica

143
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:43,200
system of interest. That. Contains essentially all

144
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,220
of the information about that replica as a

145
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:52,730
statistical ensemble and by. Maximizing that

146
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:57,160
entropy to. Get to thermodynamic equilibrium.

147
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:00,130
Taking the derivative, we get the temperature and

148
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:04,600
we get the result that I have already referenced

149
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,500
before, that it is the temperature that shows up

150
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:12,430
in that Boltzmann factor and therefore in the

151
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:14,470
partitioned function. And therefore it is the

152
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:18,580
temperature that completely specifies the system

153
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:24,170
we're interested in. And this is the. Key takeaway

154
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:26,690
message of the replica trick, all of that talk

155
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:30,620
about replicas and the total system of lots of

156
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:34,460
replicas with conserve energy, that all drops away.

157
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:40,010
All that matters is the temperature that the

158
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,640
condition of the dynamic equilibrium connects to

159
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:47,600
the partition function and therefore specifies

160
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,360
along with the conserved particle number that's

161
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,820
always coming along for the ride. We have the

162
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:55,130
temperature and conserve particle numbers

163
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:59,180
specifying all the details of our canonical system

164
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:03,890
with no more reference to the form of that thermal

165
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:06,530
reservoir. It just has to be president to set the

166
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:09,740
temperature. And beyond that, it doesn't matter.

167
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,540
The one thing I'll say about the derived qualities,

168
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:19,680
since I'm going on a bit bit long with that story

169
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,820
about the replica trick,

170
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:27,660
is that part of the homework coming up in a few

171
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:33,000
weeks will be to derive the heat capacity, which

172
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,410
is the dependence of the average internal energy

173
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:41,490
of the system on the temperature that is now the

174
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:44,940
fundamental independent variable characterizing

175
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:45,540
the system.

176
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:52,190
If you plug in the expression that we have for the

177
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:59,010
energy, you will find a relation between. The

178
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:02,190
fluctuations in the energy about his mean value

179
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:06,420
and the heat capacity of the derivative or the

180
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:10,440
response of the average energy to this control

181
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,810
parameter or the temperature. And this is an

182
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:17,780
example of a fluctuation response relation or for

183
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,550
somewhat obscure historical reasons, what's known

184
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:23,640
as the fluctuation dissipation relation that.

185
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:29,430
Appears quite generally in statistical physics,

186
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,370
another example being the relation that while the

187
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:36,490
law, the law of diffusion that we looked at in

188
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:41,020
week one, which is what Einstein derived when

189
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:44,740
analyzing Brownian motion, using statistical

190
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:47,530
physics, that law of diffusion is another example

191
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:50,560
of the fluctuation dissipation theorem.

192
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:57,130
And wrapping up with the example of.

193
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:05,760
The spin system. And the different behavior of the

194
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:10,170
spin system, depending on what information is

195
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:14,220
physically knowable about it, some of the

196
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:20,340
takeaways to see from this example are. The.

197
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:26,800
Concept of the Crown State and the excited states

198
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,880
where now the canonical ensemble where the

199
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:35,260
probability of a microstates depends exponentially

200
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:40,030
on the energy of that microstates, it becomes

201
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:43,660
important. So we have some non-zero probability of

202
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:47,590
sampling any micro state in the system, regardless

203
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:49,900
of what its energy is, that energy is no longer

204
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:53,290
conserved. But there is a probabilistic preference

205
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:58,360
to sample the states with the the lower or the

206
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:01,360
lowest energy, that lowest energy state being

207
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,960
known as the ground state. And as the temperature

208
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:10,760
decreases. The factor of the temperature in the

209
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:14,160
Boltzmann factor to the minus energy divided by

210
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,690
temperature makes that sensitivity to the energy

211
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:21,030
more and more significant. So as the temperature

212
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:24,720
approaches absolute zero, the economical system

213
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,410
really freezes in battleground states and the

214
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:33,240
entropy accordingly vanishes. Because there's

215
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:37,890
really only one state with a non-zero probability

216
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:43,500
of being realized and the logarithm of one is the

217
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,840
entropy, which is zero. One day the number of

218
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:49,260
microstates in that limit of absolute zero

219
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:53,400
temperature and at low temperatures, we can see

220
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:58,320
the effects of higher energy, excited states in

221
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:01,860
these derived quantities, the internal energy and

222
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:06,150
the entropy. In the case of this spin system, that

223
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:10,440
effect is exponential in the energy difference

224
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,410
between the ground state and the first excited

225
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:16,410
state, what's known as the energy gap. That's

226
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:22,380
generically true for the energy. And systems that

227
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:25,260
have this non-zero energy gap rather than a

228
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:30,240
continuous, continuously varying possible energy

229
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,990
use, it's a little bit different. That's. There's

230
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:37,840
not such a strong statement we can say about the

231
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:44,110
entropy, what we can look at is contrasting the so

232
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:48,540
those facts, the. The zero temperature limit of

233
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:53,220
the energy and entropy is the same, regardless of

234
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:55,920
whether or not we can distinguish these spins,

235
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,910
what information is intrinsic to the system? There

236
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:02,610
are bigger differences at non-zero temperature and

237
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:06,480
in particular physically observable differences in

238
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,050
things like the energy of the system as a function

239
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:14,280
of temperature. So there is physical content to

240
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:17,420
the information that is knowable about the system.

241
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:21,960
And there's also a very striking difference in the

242
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:26,670
entropy in the limit of very high temperatures

243
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:32,150
where. We approximately recover the micro

244
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:35,570
canonical behavior, what's going on there is that

245
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:38,060
in the high temperature limits, the temperature is

246
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:42,020
so much larger than the energy of any individual

247
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:45,590
spin in the system, that to a good approximation,

248
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:51,590
we can say that the the energy is effectively

249
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:55,910
vanishing. So all microstates have that same

250
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:00,050
negligible energy. And we get back to the micro

251
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:04,310
canonical case as the limit here. But in the case

252
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:10,420
where the spins are distinguishable. We calculate

253
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:15,400
that the entropy at high temperatures is the

254
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:19,750
number of spins and times, the logarithm of two,

255
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:23,200
whereas in the case where we where it is not

256
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,080
possible in principle to distinguish the spins,

257
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,860
the entropy is much smaller. It is the logarithm

258
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:33,130
of one plus one. So approximately the logarithm of

259
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:36,430
N for a large number of spins. So that's an

260
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:41,140
exponential difference in the energy. That is a

261
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:44,290
direct consequence of the exponential difference

262
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:47,260
in the number of possible microstates. We can

263
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:52,090
distinguish all those things we have to do the n

264
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:56,170
different microstates that differ by the values

265
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:58,390
that those distinguishable spins can have. When we

266
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:01,600
can't distinguish those spins, then the

267
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,320
microstates are characterized only by the energies

268
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,870
that they have and there are only and plus one

269
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:12,130
possible energy levels in the system of an spins.

270
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:18,260
So that is the the first application of the

271
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:21,530
canonical approach, demonstrating that information

272
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:25,880
is physical and in the next two weeks we will look

273
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,390
at.

274
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:33,300
A bit broader implications of the canonical

275
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:37,680
ensemble to ideal gases and so dynamical cycles

276
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:42,330
that include refrigerators and heat engines. So I

277
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:46,860
will finally, after a bit of a lengthy diatribe,

278
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:50,270
wrap up this wrap up. With that.
