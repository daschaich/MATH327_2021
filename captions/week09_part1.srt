00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:05,040
Hello and welcome back to statistical physics.

2
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:08,450
This is the first video for week nine of the

3
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:12,560
molecule, providing a brief summary of the context,

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:16,550
motivations and key learning outcomes for this

5
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:21,590
week's material on quantum gases of fermions. And

6
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:24,590
bringing materials onto the screen here

7
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:29,660
can start just by orientating ourselves in the big

8
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:32,780
picture of the module where we are, where we've

9
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:35,750
been and where we are headed, where in week nine

10
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:39,050
we are wrapping up not only our consideration of

11
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:42,440
quantum gases as an application of the grand

12
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:45,770
economical ensemble, but actually taking our last

13
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:50,060
look at idealised systems whose constituent

14
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:53,090
particles do not interact with each other, which

15
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:56,960
is all we have been considering in the module up

16
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,660
to this point. And next week we will dive into the

17
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:03,500
much more complicated situation of interacting

18
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:08,840
systems where we no longer make this idealized

19
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,570
approximation of not interacting particles. And we

20
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:14,090
will see that things become much more difficult,

21
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:17,330
much more quickly in that case. But that is for

22
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:22,430
next week and for this week. We have formulas to

23
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:27,530
deal with and in particular focusing on not

24
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:32,300
relativistic fermions, so particles that obey the

25
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:37,100
same relation between energy and momentum that we

26
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:40,520
worked with in some detail all the way back in

27
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:43,580
week four in the context of the canonical example

28
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:49,040
where the energy is just given by the particle

29
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,250
momentum squared divided by twice its mass. And

30
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:57,810
just as in week four, we quantize the particles

31
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:59,790
momentum and therefore their energy use in order

32
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:05,670
to make the petition function well defined in this

33
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:08,070
case this week, the grand canonical partition

34
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:10,950
function that depends on temperature and chemical

35
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:13,590
potential, allowing both the energy and particle

36
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,890
number to fluctuate. And we take the quantum

37
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:21,300
approach of something over all of those discrete

38
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,910
energy levels. And considering the possible

39
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:27,060
occupation numbers that each energy level could

40
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:31,110
have rather than the classical approach that we

41
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:34,830
did back in week four, where we consider the

42
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:38,280
particles one by one summed over all of the

43
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,350
possible energies that each individual particle

44
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:43,710
could have and then introduced some correction

45
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:47,910
factors for or to address the overcounting that

46
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:50,670
resulted from that classical approach. In the

47
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,850
quantum approach. There is no overcounting and in

48
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:57,630
particular in the low temperature regime of.

49
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,860
Fermions, we have the somewhat unusual or at least

50
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:07,580
unfamiliar circumstance where the only possible

51
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:11,390
occupation numbers for these energy levels are

52
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,820
zero and one in energy level can either be

53
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:17,600
unoccupied or empty or it can be occupied by a

54
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:21,230
single FIRREA, which completely fills it and does

55
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:26,570
not allow any other on to occupy that same energy

56
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:28,970
level, assuming, as we will, that all of the

57
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:32,900
fermions in this case are identical. And we don't

58
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,540
have multiple species of particles which would be

59
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:38,840
described by separate energy levels for each

60
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,560
species.

61
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,900
And with that set up of fermions back in week

62
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:48,020
seven, we derived the great canonical partition

63
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,750
function and the corresponding great nonlocal

64
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:55,180
potential for that situation of occupation numbers,

65
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:59,900
either zero or one in what remains is to plug in

66
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:05,540
the specific energies for these fermions in in

67
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,610
this case, the non relativistic RÃ©gine. So

68
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:11,270
providing a contrast with the photon gas we

69
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:14,090
consider last week and at low temperatures,

70
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:18,020
revealing the effects solely due to quantum

71
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:20,300
physics or what we are assuming

72
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:26,450
as an Anzac's that we based on quantum physics but

73
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:29,510
don't require any background knowledge of the

74
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:35,660
topic to see how the low temperature fermoy on gas

75
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:39,080
differs compared to the classical approach that we

76
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,900
investigated back before the term break and

77
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:48,410
plugging in this energy into the grand economic

78
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:51,200
potential and importantly retaining the chemical

79
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,630
potential, which for fermions can be either

80
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:58,700
positive or negative. We can do the same sort of

81
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:03,350
calculation of integrating over the the possible

82
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:08,000
momentum rather than something over them. And if

83
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,540
we change variables to express the grand canonical

84
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:16,430
potential in terms of the Fermi on energy rather

85
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:21,890
than the momentum or the integer labels that

86
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:26,000
classify the different quantized values of that

87
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,670
momentum. We end up with this equation, one of

88
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:33,440
five for the great economic potential that

89
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,470
determines all of the large scale properties of

90
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:41,390
the system arising from the the quantum statistics

91
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:45,470
obeyed by each of the individual particles that

92
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:51,860
that compose it. And. All that we need to do

93
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:54,320
starting from this potential, is take the

94
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,900
appropriate derivatives to extract things like the

95
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:00,980
average internal energy particle, no pressure and

96
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:06,020
entropy. And you will be interested in doing so at

97
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:08,510
low temperatures, driving the equation of states

98
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:14,060
and seeing how the quantum gas at low temperatures

99
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:18,470
smoothly matches on to the classical system that

100
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:22,220
we saw in week seven is reproduced in the

101
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:24,290
appropriate high temperature limit, where the

102
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:27,980
chemical potential goes to a large negative value

103
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,350
as the temperature goes to a large positive value

104
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:34,610
in order to retain a finite number of particles in

105
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:38,160
the system. But starting off with some

106
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,680
consideration of the number of particles in the

107
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,630
system and the great canonical approach that is

108
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:45,570
given just by the negative derivative with respect

109
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:49,050
to chemical potential of the great economical

110
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:55,830
potential. And similarly to how you looked first

111
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:59,610
at the energy density as our last week in the

112
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:01,650
photon gas context, we looked at the energy

113
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:05,370
density of a photon gas as an integral over a

114
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:09,630
spectral density, which matched on to what we

115
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:14,880
could observe. It will prove useful to take a

116
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,250
similar approach this week and look at the

117
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:20,730
particle number density and also the internal

118
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:24,390
energy density as integrals over the energy of

119
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:28,620
some function of that energy, which is known as

120
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:33,210
the the Fermi function. And if we keep the

121
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:36,960
constant multiplicative factors outside of that

122
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,930
family function, in contrast to what we did with

123
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:43,290
the Planck distribution last week, we end up with

124
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:45,930
something that looks very much like the average

125
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:49,830
occupation. No. Arrived back in Section seven

126
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:52,980
point five, the main difference being that instead

127
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:56,430
of fixing the particular value of the energy

128
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:59,220
corresponding to the energy level whose occupation

129
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:02,880
number we were considering back in week seven,

130
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:08,130
here we are looking at this exponential function

131
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:12,450
as a function of the energy, which also depends on

132
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,430
the inverse temperature data and chemical

133
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:20,070
potential. New and if we. Rearrange this very

134
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,920
function to write it in terms of dimensionless

135
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:26,280
ratios of that energy divided by chemical

136
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,040
potential in the chemical potential divided by the

137
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:33,780
temperature, we can highlight its two main

138
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:40,990
features at both as functions of. The temperature

139
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:46,900
given by this dimensionless number with respect to

140
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,780
the chemical potential as well as the dependence

141
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:52,690
on the energy, again, compared to the chemical

142
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:55,510
potential which is shown in this figure here.

143
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:01,640
So the two things to pick out are, first, that the

144
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:05,270
point where the energy is equal to the chemical

145
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:09,920
potential, that ratio equals one is a special

146
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,470
point in this plot where all of these different

147
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:15,320
curves for different temperatures intersect at a

148
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:19,210
value of one half. The argument of the exponential

149
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:21,980
zero of the exponential itself is then one, and

150
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:26,570
the family function is one over one plus one gives

151
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:29,690
us a half or any value of the temperature. And at

152
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:35,510
lower energies there is a distinct. Temperature

153
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:38,840
dependent, so rare that the opposite temperature

154
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,670
dependence compared to the situation at higher

155
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:44,690
energies, so a higher energy is a decrease in

156
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:47,600
temperature going from a relatively large value

157
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,080
equal to the chemical potential in the solid red

158
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:55,760
curve down to a much smaller value. Only one

159
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,740
percent of the chemical potential given by the

160
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:01,280
black curve. You see that at higher energies, this

161
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:05,070
change in temperature leads to. A rapidly

162
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:09,240
decreasing family function, in fact, exponentially

163
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,780
decreasing, whereas at lower temperatures, the

164
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:15,990
family function increases and the exponential

165
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:19,740
factor itself there is decreasing, heading towards

166
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:22,530
zero exponentially quickly. So that all that is

167
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:27,450
left is that one divided by the one in the

168
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:30,270
denominator. So the primary function is

169
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:33,660
approaching one from below at temperatures lower

170
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,390
than the sorry energies, lower than the chemical

171
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:39,240
potential with the speed of approach governed by

172
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:43,740
the temperature. And it approaches zero for energy

173
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:46,200
is higher than the chemical potential, again, with

174
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,990
the speed of approach to zero governed by the

175
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:53,540
temperature. And at low temperatures as shown by

176
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:56,090
the black curve here, the family function can

177
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:59,450
become dull, approximated by a simple step

178
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:03,980
function where it is one for all energies, less

179
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:07,160
than the chemical potential, which in this context

180
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:10,190
at low temperatures needs to be positive in order

181
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:13,850
to have any non-zero number of particles remaining

182
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:17,300
in our great economical system and at higher

183
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:20,180
energies larger than that chemical potential. The

184
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:23,960
family function is zero, and the interpretation of

185
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:29,450
this is that all of the energy levels that have

186
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:32,660
values are the energy up to the chemical potential

187
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:37,490
are filled at these low temperatures, and none of

188
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:40,310
the energy levels with values of the energy larger

189
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:42,650
than the chemical potential are filled. They are

190
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:44,960
all empty or unoccupied.

191
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:50,990
And that interpretation connects to the similarity

192
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,480
between this Fermoy function in the average

193
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,150
occupation number that we computed a couple of

194
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:59,900
weeks ago and can also be seen in the computation

195
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:04,520
of the average particle number and internal energy

196
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:08,030
that, given how long this recording is already,

197
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:13,370
you will set aside for the next video and return

198
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:20,960
to to to go through. In. In that second video for

199
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,130
this week.
