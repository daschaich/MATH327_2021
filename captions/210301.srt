1
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:06,230
Well, while we wait for a few more people to join

2
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:10,280
us for week four, I have started recording this in

3
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:10,760
Ken.

4
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:16,170
Get under way with some of the logistical

5
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,340
organization.

6
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:25,320
So as that recording indicates, the there was

7
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,980
consensus to record the Synchronoss sessions in

8
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,030
that Week three questionnaire and take a brief

9
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:37,470
look at some of the other feedback and responses

10
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:42,540
to that questionnaire just after giving folks a

11
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,830
couple more minutes to accumulate. And I realized

12
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:50,010
last night that this also saves me from having to

13
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,250
record an asynchronous discussion of that

14
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:57,720
questionnaire. I can just upload this recording

15
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,740
and then it is available to everyone with no

16
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:05,910
further work from me. In the meantime, while we go

17
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:11,010
through that questionnaire, I'm also going to.

18
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:18,550
Activate the usual first question for every

19
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:22,780
meeting, if you have any questions for me about

20
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:25,720
the asynchronous materials, the computer project

21
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:30,610
that is due tomorrow or requests for supplemental

22
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:31,360
recordings.

23
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:39,250
You have now the whole everywhere, usual full

24
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:42,550
everywhere link is up and activated for those to

25
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:43,570
come in.

26
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:53,910
While we go through. The. Week three questionnaire,

27
00:01:54,360 --> 00:02:01,820
which is. Over on. This is here.

28
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:09,790
So we got about 30 percent response rate, which I

29
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:14,200
believe is typical and suggests 70 percent are

30
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:19,210
sufficiently content not to bother. And of the 30

31
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:20,830
percent responses we got the.

32
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:26,850
Difficulty of the course is, on average, just a

33
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:29,790
bit more difficult than easy, and I should say, I

34
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:34,470
don't know why this canvas quiz is suggesting

35
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:37,000
there was a right answer for any of these and that

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,650
wasn't set. That's just being silly.

37
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:46,710
The difficulty is a little bit more than we got in

38
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,930
this quiz last year, which is not surprising given

39
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:51,990
the challenges of learning remotely. So those of

40
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:54,870
you who are finding it moderately or very

41
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:58,410
difficult, I encourage you to get in touch with

42
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,100
any questions or confusions that arise, whether

43
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:05,850
that's in relation to the asynchronous materials,

44
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:11,490
these discussions or the assignments and the pace

45
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:13,260
is also just about.

46
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:19,370
Slightly more fast and slow, but hands are split

47
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:21,830
between those, there was a free tax response

48
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:25,670
saying that one of the little fast answers there

49
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:29,120
was selected by accident and canvas wasn't

50
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,980
allowing it to be changed, which is another

51
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:35,840
interesting shortcoming of that quiz. Almost

52
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,980
everyone finds the materials accessible, findable,

53
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:42,650
audible, illegible. Almost no one finds them

54
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:45,920
sufficient. And as I mentioned, there's is

55
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,860
consensus for the recording that is going on now.

56
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:55,040
And let's see, 70 percent of the free response

57
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,250
answers down at the end were also left blank. But

58
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:02,240
almost all of the others in relation to the

59
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,880
insufficiency of these materials asked for while

60
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,650
these recessions, these synchronous sessions to be

61
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:15,530
recorded and sample responses to the the gaps of

62
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:18,740
the notes, those active learning activities to be

63
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,160
uploaded to the canvas site, which started

64
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,500
happening last week while the quiz was still

65
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:30,080
running. So hopefully those two steps will suffice

66
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:35,840
to flip the balance for the. Sufficiency of the

67
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:40,140
materials and. Let's see.

68
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:46,530
Can also.

69
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,230
Open up the.

70
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,240
Questions to any further remarks on that

71
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,000
questionnaire, if there are any, and I see there

72
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,250
is. One question coming through the. Polls so far.

73
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,400
That.

74
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:18,650
And see. What should I share on which screen?

75
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,470
You know, I guess the last bit of logistics before

76
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:37,490
diving into materials is that the computer project

77
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:41,990
is due by the end of the day in the U.K. tomorrow.

78
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:44,540
I've got some questions about it.

79
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:54,460
Over the past week and some submissions as well

80
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:58,870
over the past week, and seeing that there are

81
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,360
questions coming in through people everywhere,

82
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,490
both about the week for notes and the computer

83
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:07,300
project.

84
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:12,880
So let me deal with the computer project versus

85
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,140
that is a bit more urgent, perhaps, and also part

86
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:22,420
of the logistical introduction to the session. One

87
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:28,510
question is. Available here? Not exactly on.

88
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:35,210
If this opens up.

89
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:45,620
Things are slowly loading. And there is this

90
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:48,170
question, are marks available for attempting to

91
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:51,320
code, even if it does not run? And I'll say yes,

92
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:51,710
the.

93
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:03,180
Now, the effort to set up the code and see how

94
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,400
close you get to a correct solution will be

95
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:09,610
acknowledged and provided with some marks. That's

96
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:13,290
a quick answer to that question and then question

97
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:15,840
about talking through the demo. Examples of what

98
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,980
the code means, which I can certainly spend a few

99
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:25,350
minutes doing right now, should be able to get to

100
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:34,020
that demo from. The canvass sites. Up with this

101
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:39,670
link, for some reason, Candace tries to embed the

102
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:43,560
Google collaboratory inside itself, don't know why

103
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:46,140
it tries to do that rather than just opening the

104
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:51,180
link as it should. But here is the demo. And the

105
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:56,250
idea is that, you know, this is. A notebook set up,

106
00:07:56,250 --> 00:08:00,330
so all of these little code blocks are explained

107
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:03,950
in the comments that come along in front of them.

108
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:08,210
I don't want to edit those comments just to say

109
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:11,750
that, you know, what what explanation I give here

110
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:17,120
is going to echo and summarize pretty much the the

111
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:20,780
written comments in the text, just like the.

112
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,900
The lecture notes are only a transcription of the

113
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:28,020
lectures I would be given if we were doing

114
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:32,970
lectures this year, so as discussed. In this first

115
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:37,290
text, Locke. We start off by loading some

116
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:42,930
libraries that maybe I should try to zoom in to

117
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:45,900
this code, see if I can make it a bit more legible.

118
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,740
That larger on this screen, sharing and recording

119
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:55,960
some standard libraries with mathematical

120
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,450
functions like the square roots and random numbers,

121
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:03,640
as well as two very widespread utilities,

122
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:09,520
numerical python, num, pi and matplotlib, both of

123
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:14,740
which simplify it more than they complicate these

124
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:20,860
sorts of exercises by providing numerical routines

125
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:25,270
like easy array manipulation, a matplotlib. By

126
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:29,710
providing fancy plots we can. Try to keep the

127
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:32,410
keyboard from popping up whenever I touch anything

128
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:36,760
on this demo. Just checking the versions of those

129
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:41,720
libraries that are being used. And going on in

130
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,750
this first code block, we see the random number

131
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:49,910
generator generates 100000 samples.

132
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:56,460
Using that, well, pseudo random number generator,

133
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,530
there's information about what pseudo random

134
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:05,550
numbers mean in. The demo and the exercise and

135
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:09,270
accumulate these two running solms, the vacuum,

136
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:12,900
expectation value and the vacuum expectation value

137
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:20,800
of the square of. Let's see. I can't use the pen

138
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:26,040
to draw on the tablet with. This window of.

139
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:35,490
Each. So this data is an array in each step of

140
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:39,690
this for loop, we append a random number to this

141
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:42,750
array, which is two times the square root of you,

142
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:45,990
drawn from the usual uniform probability

143
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:52,380
distribution that is discussed in that text. And

144
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:56,010
while we could then after the fact, reconstruct

145
00:10:56,010 --> 00:11:00,480
the mean and square roots from or of the mean and

146
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:02,790
standard deviation square root of the variance

147
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:06,480
from that array directly, it's much more efficient

148
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:12,560
to do so by accumulating these rolling sums. Which

149
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,350
if we normalize by the number of samples, which is

150
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:21,490
called are. In the computer project, we get a

151
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:26,010
meeting of about one point thirty three, a

152
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:29,200
standard deviation of about point four seven, and

153
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:32,980
I don't think I included the exact the calculation

154
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:38,500
in here, but it's easy to do separately. The exact

155
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:43,990
meaning is for thirds for this. The distribution

156
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:47,890
produced by this transformation X is two times the

157
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:50,890
square root of you and the standard deviation is

158
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:54,940
route to over three. And easy to see that four

159
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:59,020
thirds is about one point three three three three.

160
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:02,220
Which we're reproducing there to several decimal

161
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:05,070
places, and the square root of two over three is

162
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:09,450
also point for seven and change specifically if I

163
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:14,040
put it in a calculator, it is four seven one four

164
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:19,110
zero. So only about three significant figures

165
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,470
reproduce there with these hundred thousand random

166
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:23,130
samples.

167
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:29,140
Now, having saved all of the information in an

168
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:31,210
array, in addition to just accumulating those

169
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:35,910
running sums, we can plot the histogram. Which is

170
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:42,840
the number of samples that land in each of these

171
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:46,650
bins, in this case, I set fifty one bins, which

172
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:51,060
give a nice little coverage here that's not too

173
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:54,780
rough and not to fine. If I were to change that to,

174
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:59,910
say, five and execute this guy, we would get

175
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:04,890
something a bit less useful if I were to change it.

176
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:11,430
To say what I do want the keyboard to pop up is

177
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:11,820
not.

178
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:23,430
NowI. That is. Changing it to say 500. Gives

179
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:25,800
something where the bins are so narrow. There are

180
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,980
a lot more visible statistical fluctuations just

181
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,140
from the randomness of the numbers we're working

182
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:35,070
with and at the same time, on top of that

183
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:40,260
histogram plotting the expected distribution.

184
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:46,000
Which is just why is one half of X?

185
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:51,570
Back in here and.

186
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:59,140
Run the 51 beans just to have that lying around

187
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:01,390
next bit is.

188
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:08,820
Something more along the lines of the question

189
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,460
just came in. What does the code mean in the

190
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:15,240
histogram? So this X here.

191
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:18,700
Is.

192
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,390
You know, the standard rate of flight functions in

193
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:27,110
Python, so that is probably all I say about it,

194
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,260
that is the range of the plots going from zero to

195
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:34,890
two and sampling points every zero point zero one

196
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:39,780
within that range. So what's being plotted here is.

197
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:46,010
The line given by X and Y, where X here is just a.

198
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:54,150
Smooth coverage of. The range from zero to two,

199
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:57,240
which is why that is automatically picked out as

200
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,000
the range on that plot and why is the function

201
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,340
being plotted? So if I were just were to say push

202
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:12,330
that up to zero to three, you would see this

203
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:17,700
orange curve extending beyond the horizontal range

204
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,020
of that histogram.

205
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:28,360
And the last bit of the demo is a bit more

206
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:32,740
obviously the sort of thing that is being done in

207
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:36,640
the computer project, looking at random walks

208
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:42,900
where the distance of the walk, this quantity D.

209
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:48,940
In the code is adding up some number of steps with

210
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:52,930
each step length being drawn from this random

211
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:58,400
distribution X is to square root you. At the end

212
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:02,030
of each of those step walks, we record that

213
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:07,040
distance in an array of walk lengths, all this

214
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:12,380
negative one index puts it into the last entry in

215
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:16,830
the array, which was set to be zero up there. And

216
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:22,140
then divide by the number of samples and print out

217
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:26,070
what that length is in this case, where our random

218
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:31,680
numbers are always positive, we're only walking in

219
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:39,480
one direction. So the random walk always has a.

220
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:46,890
Positive final stopping points, which is given by

221
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:51,360
those numbers that are plotted there and in this

222
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,680
flight, it looks like there is a fairly direct

223
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,950
correlation between the number of steps of the

224
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:58,890
horizontal axis and the length of the lock on the

225
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:03,380
vertical axis. And if we are confident that this

226
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:07,580
is a linear function, we can fit to that linear

227
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:10,340
function. This is one of the many things America

228
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:13,940
Python provides out of the box. It will do a fit

229
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:17,000
for us so that we don't have to code up some

230
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:23,600
fitting routine with a nonlinear minimization and

231
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:28,680
that, again, now setting the X range of the plot

232
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:32,960
to be evenly spaced from zero to 80. Looking at

233
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:39,210
what lengths up to 80. We get output from the fix

234
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:45,490
this and B that. It's plotted on top of the points,

235
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:50,080
goes through them, as we expect for fit and is.

236
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:55,480
In good agreement with the points as a linear

237
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,050
function.

238
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:03,340
Now, if we don't want to assume that that function

239
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:06,880
was linear to begin with, we can fit the data to a

240
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:08,500
more general power law.

241
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:13,130
Zoomed out a while ago and I forgot to zoom back

242
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:19,580
in and here power laws are non-linear functions.

243
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:28,970
As shown, there it is, the length is some constant

244
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:31,130
times, a number of steps to some power that may

245
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:35,210
not even be an integer, but there is a standard

246
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:37,820
trick to return to power law into a linear

247
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:40,400
function, which is to take the logarithm of both

248
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:47,090
sides and fit the log of the SEP lengths as a

249
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:52,200
linear function of the number of steps. Which is

250
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:55,170
exactly what's done here, taking the log, using

251
00:18:56,310 --> 00:19:00,180
convenient numerical python utilities that act on

252
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:03,120
each element in the lists that they get as

253
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,870
arguments do that same FETs, extract that same

254
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:11,610
output, take the exponential to get back to the

255
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:14,370
constant parameter C that appears in the power

256
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:19,000
parallel itself. And then check to see how close

257
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,570
to linnear this general power law really is, the

258
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:26,410
answer is very close one point zero zero zero zero

259
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:32,740
zero eight and getting the same slope. Well, that

260
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:39,550
same mean. For the single step process in this

261
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:46,240
random walk is the slope of. This fit again for

262
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,960
thirds up to permit level fluctuations and.

263
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:53,700
PostScript says that all those fluctuations are

264
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:57,720
going to depend on the amount of data, the number

265
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:01,740
of random samples that are being used, the more

266
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:05,700
independent random samples there are, the closer

267
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:10,350
we expect the. Numerical results to agree with

268
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:12,630
those analytic predictions.

269
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,570
And that's something that you can test with this.

270
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:23,780
Demo, so I'll pause just for a moment to see if

271
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:27,020
there are any follow up questions in the.

272
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:32,140
In the poll everywhere or directly through zum.

273
00:20:55,150 --> 00:21:00,690
And in the meantime, the. Switch to the other

274
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:03,410
question that pops.

275
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:08,270
One question came in just as I was about to leave

276
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:12,710
in the lines to start with ENPI, I was showing off

277
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:13,130
here.

278
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:19,590
You know, what that is doing is using a function

279
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:24,270
that has been imported into our code at the very

280
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:29,190
start with these import lines, we get access to

281
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:33,840
all of the routines that are provided by those

282
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:39,300
libraries, numerical python routines from Dumphy,

283
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:43,380
which is abbreviated as ENPI, just to keep things

284
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:47,400
shorter and then plotting routines from matplotlib,

285
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:50,820
which is abbreviated as p.l.c. just to keep that

286
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:56,490
shorter. So all of these commands that start with

287
00:21:56,490 --> 00:22:02,390
ENPI are using. Some functions, subroutines,

288
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:06,110
utilities, capabilities that come from numerical

289
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:07,940
python and.

290
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:12,500
I'm seeing here they don't show up for the first

291
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:17,050
few, there are, in addition these. Commands that

292
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:21,760
start with the math library in Python. So, for

293
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,400
instance, the square root here, that's the same

294
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,340
sort of principle. Once we import mathematical

295
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:30,730
functions and numerical python, everything that is

296
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:36,800
implemented in. Those libraries is accessed by

297
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:40,340
telling you the code where to look to find a

298
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:44,420
subroutine known as Holly Fit, which is a

299
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:47,870
polynomial fitting Rasyid. And if there's ever any

300
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:51,110
doubt about what a routine is called or what

301
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:55,640
functionality is available, then the thing to do

302
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,820
is to Google it in. Python is so widely used that

303
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:03,740
you will get tons of hits and explanations telling

304
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:09,740
you the proper syntax and capabilities that are

305
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:14,300
available which make everything you need is

306
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,730
illustrated here so you can copy and paste with no

307
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:25,000
searching or. Independent study done, that is what

308
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:32,710
is going on with those lines, math, MPLX and TLT.

309
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,360
OK.

310
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:43,940
So the last.

311
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:50,620
Tablet is doing that thing of rearranging.

312
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,170
These questions, again, as I touch them, and I

313
00:23:58,170 --> 00:23:59,400
think this was the.

314
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:07,050
First, well, let's see. Go back here if it loads

315
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:10,890
and there was one question about the week four

316
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:15,450
notes, equation fifty four.

317
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:26,950
And let me just. Remind myself what. Was in. That

318
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:36,050
equation 54. Here and this, I think. I will

319
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:43,390
proceed by. Wrapping up the. Last question to.

320
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:48,370
I plan to ask about week three just to make sure

321
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:51,850
that all of everything interesting in the

322
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:54,760
canonical ensemble setup is covered, and then

323
00:24:54,760 --> 00:25:00,610
we'll make sure we get to equation 50 for the

324
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,950
effective indistinguishably to do that either

325
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:09,240
later today or more likely on Thursday.

326
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:14,690
That might give more of you more of a chance to

327
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:18,650
get through these notes after the computer project

328
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:23,360
is done and dusted and all submitted, so hopefully

329
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:29,300
that is not putting putting off the question, but.

330
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:36,860
Promising to get to it in due course. And that

331
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:41,210
will let us go a bit more linearly through the

332
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:45,260
remainder of week. Three, where I just really

333
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:50,250
wanted to ask. That one more of these gaffes,

334
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:53,940
which was the one that got shuffled around this

335
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,410
here on page 52.

336
00:25:57,590 --> 00:26:03,450
Where I can. Activate that question and just check

337
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:06,630
in what the internal energy.

338
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:15,920
Was. For. The system of indistinguishable spins in

339
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:21,970
a solid considered in the last section of the. The

340
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:22,750
week three.

341
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:25,880
Notes.

342
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:31,310
So let me.

343
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:40,850
Pull that up here, this is the box I'm talking

344
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:41,360
about.

345
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:51,700
And I'll pause for a minute or two to let some

346
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:55,450
responses to that poll come in.

347
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:20,960
And some are still coming in, so just a slight bit

348
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,190
longer for those who.

349
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:28,670
Maybe working through the. Calculation.

350
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,560
Rather than pulling up.

351
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,540
Something that was already available.

352
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:03,110
And the responses seem to have. Stabilized.

353
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:07,480
With a.

354
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:16,850
Preference for this hyperbolic tangent, but some

355
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:22,040
some responses for one overall hyperbolic.

356
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:30,530
Cosine squared, so just quickly. Run through this

357
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:34,740
derivative without going into too much commentary

358
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:42,580
that. Know, multiplying through the speed on if

359
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:44,140
somebody the.

360
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:49,000
Helmholtz, free energy for the case of

361
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:54,730
distinguishable spin's. We have minus in out front,

362
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:58,850
and then the beat is on top and bottom canceled.

363
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:03,380
So is the derivative of the log. Of.

364
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:09,940
Twice this hyperbolic cosine with the derivative

365
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:10,930
of log is.

366
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:18,290
Won over the arguments of the law, the.

367
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:25,450
And then the chain rule gives us the derivative of

368
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:31,060
what is inside the log, so that then is to H and

369
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:33,820
then derivative of hyperbolic.

370
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,830
Cosine is the positive. Hyperbolic sign the synch,

371
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:47,440
and that then is to cancel and there's a minus in

372
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:56,060
age in synch over. Coche is Tange, which hopefully

373
00:30:56,060 --> 00:31:01,880
was, yes, one of the. Answers here, where the one

374
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:06,140
that was preferred and go on from there directly

375
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:13,190
to ask now about. The heat capacity for the same

376
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:14,510
system, so given the.

377
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:18,460
Energy that.

378
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:25,370
We just checked in that gap, the heat capacity was

379
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:32,680
not something that was asked for in. The notes for

380
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:35,950
this particular spin system, but it was discussed.

381
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:44,460
Earlier in this week and try to get myself back up

382
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:48,150
to that discussion and that definition, so this is

383
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:51,540
a calculation that you most likely did not.

384
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:57,110
Prepare in advance, so I'll give you. A couple of

385
00:31:57,110 --> 00:32:03,640
minutes to. Consider it based on the results for

386
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:08,120
the. Energy for these spins in the magnetic field

387
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:14,150
h that we just went through. Quickly just now.

388
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:36,920
So does anyone want any more time to keep working

389
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:37,820
on this?

390
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:18,800
Sounds like not so hop over and see that everyone

391
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,970
agrees about taking the derivative of a. Maybe you

392
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:27,110
just have that memorized. I personally can't be

393
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:31,130
bothered to memorize derivatives of these hyper

394
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:34,190
geometric functions. So I always just work through

395
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:38,660
those derivatives from the definitions of the

396
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:44,030
functions. But so given that everyone agrees with

397
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:49,630
that result. I think I won't go through that

398
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:53,110
calculation, but will instead just emphasize the.

399
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:02,950
Facts that this heat capacity is generically

400
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:07,240
positive and always not negative, and I'll do that

401
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:11,140
by trying to write on the screen share tablets,

402
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,240
just a quick plot of.

403
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:21,830
Of dysfunction that came out, you know, normalized.

404
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:28,430
Just so that we don't have to worry about what

405
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:33,740
these parameters in and age and Bita are. So if I

406
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:35,270
import

407
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:41,630
a numerical python and matplotlib and then go back

408
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:43,430
and forth between.

409
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:49,100
The demo and this.

410
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:54,680
New

411
00:37:56,750 --> 00:38:02,950
notebook to. Set up a quick plot.

412
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:07,670
Of that function.

413
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:14,740
If I can.

414
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:19,340
Get this tablet to behave.

415
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:25,690
There it is.

416
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:36,460
And why you did not call me when I told it to you,

417
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:37,180
I don't know.

418
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:42,670
Well, much easier to do on.

419
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:52,690
A actual laptop or computer where? Copying and

420
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:57,610
pasting should work as expected, and I may just

421
00:38:57,610 --> 00:38:59,980
need to rewrite all of this.

422
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,120
From.

423
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,000
And that's why.

424
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:14,220
So happy somehow my keyboard got.

425
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,610
Reset.

426
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:21,970
So that.

427
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:26,960
The back to that.

428
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:32,310
Lay out where the keys are, where I expect them to

429
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:35,550
be and how the letter should do what I tell them

430
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:38,420
to. So let's just look at this function from, say,

431
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:39,360
zero to 10

432
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,090
and.

433
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:50,240
If we divide out by so this is a reminder that

434
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:53,480
heat capacity is in bid eight squared over

435
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:57,260
hyperbolic cosine of bead age, so dividing out and.

436
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:02,910
Saying that is one calling beta X, that function

437
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:08,250
is X squared over hyperbolic coshed squared

438
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:14,040
of X, where that hyperbolic Kalisz is one of the

439
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:20,050
many things that numerical python provides. And

440
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:25,540
hopefully this will show us a non-negative and

441
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:30,520
even positive function, which we are seeing here,

442
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:35,650
so that exercise took more effort than it should

443
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:41,290
have, but we got the result of the heat capacity

444
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:45,190
for a system of indistinguishable spins in an

445
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:47,620
external magnetic field, which is.

446
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:53,810
Always non-negative and approaches zero in the two

447
00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:59,080
limits where X goes to zero. Which is exs, the

448
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,790
inverse temperatures, that is the infinite

449
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:03,910
temperature limit, and it also approaches zero

450
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:07,780
where X, which is data goes to infinity, which is

451
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:12,280
the zero temperature limit. And there are. Two

452
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:16,300
quite distinct interpretations of the vanishing

453
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:19,930
heat capacity in those two different limits, where

454
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:24,370
in the limit of infinite temperature, what's going

455
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:29,410
on is that once we have that temperature being,

456
00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:31,750
you know, approaching infinity and adding just a

457
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:33,370
little bit more to.

458
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:38,100
Consider this.

459
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:43,650
Derivative here is essentially having no effect,

460
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:46,240
there's no response to a small change in the

461
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,010
temperature when that temperature is already

462
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,700
approaching infinitely large and the opposite

463
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:57,490
limit where the temperature is going to zero in

464
00:41:57,490 --> 00:42:00,780
absolute zero. We saw last week that the spin

465
00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:03,940
system gets stuck in its ground state. There are

466
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:09,850
never any fluctuations about that energy. And as

467
00:42:09,850 --> 00:42:12,610
this is a fluctuation response relation, that

468
00:42:12,610 --> 00:42:16,660
absence of fluctuations gives us an absence of

469
00:42:16,990 --> 00:42:21,250
responses. So vanishing heat capacity in those two

470
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:25,150
limits and positive for all finite, non-zero

471
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:25,870
values.

472
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:28,970
So.

473
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:36,710
That is it for week three for me, this is a last

474
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:40,040
chance for you to ask any further questions about

475
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:46,690
that through Zoome and in the. The polls I will

476
00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:52,760
hop over to. The first question. I was planning to

477
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:53,780
discuss on.

478
00:42:57,830 --> 00:43:02,730
The week for notes, which is. A bit earlier than

479
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:06,600
the. Question that came in about equation fifty

480
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:09,930
four. We'll get to that on Thursday at this point

481
00:43:09,930 --> 00:43:13,020
and not today. So that is something to look

482
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:17,340
forward to that's coming. The question now is

483
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:23,820
looking at page fifty nine. This is the first gap

484
00:43:24,090 --> 00:43:24,600
in.

485
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:29,650
Week four, and that is, I think, page two of the

486
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:34,150
PDF here, that once we have introduced downspouts

487
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:38,710
to disguise the momentum that a particle could

488
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:43,060
have in an ideal gas in this container with a

489
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:48,850
particular volume, VQ the V is allocute.

490
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:55,850
And the question becomes, what are the energy

491
00:43:55,850 --> 00:44:01,700
levels of that system and the question in the.

492
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:07,040
Whole everywhere now is what are the three lowest

493
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:08,300
energy levels.

494
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:13,480
Responses have started coming in and I'll give it

495
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:17,510
another minute or two and probably given the time

496
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:22,630
we'll wrap up with discussion of of these energy

497
00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:28,740
levels, which will start off with. Next next time

498
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:29,520
on Thursday.

499
00:47:14,990 --> 00:47:18,680
At the moment, there's an even split of responses,

500
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:21,230
so I'll wait just a little bit longer.

501
00:47:24,630 --> 00:47:28,170
For tiebreakers to come in.

502
00:48:32,290 --> 00:48:35,890
And in the interests of ending approximately

503
00:48:35,890 --> 00:48:42,640
ontime. We'll take a look at those split results.

504
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:50,150
Which are 50 percent, four zero one and two times

505
00:48:50,150 --> 00:48:52,610
this quantity, which is the same everywhere,

506
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:57,950
versus zero one and four, where those are the

507
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:03,860
the two most compelling responses, given the

508
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:08,630
energy that you presumably saw this squared over

509
00:49:08,630 --> 00:49:12,710
two M with P given up there and P squared the

510
00:49:13,190 --> 00:49:14,330
inner product.

511
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:21,270
You've seen that this quantity. Each bar squared,

512
00:49:21,270 --> 00:49:24,570
PI squared over two and L squared appeared in all

513
00:49:24,570 --> 00:49:26,700
of those possible responses, and then the inner

514
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:33,450
product is the sum KEX squared plus K Y squared

515
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:38,280
plus casette squared, each of which is a

516
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:43,890
non-negative integer. So the lowest energy comes

517
00:49:43,890 --> 00:49:49,230
when all three of those are zero and that energy

518
00:49:49,230 --> 00:49:54,710
is. Is just zero, the next lowest energy comes

519
00:49:54,710 --> 00:49:59,660
when. One of them is one, the others are zero, and

520
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:05,420
that energy is one times that quantity, each per

521
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:09,020
squared, squared over two miles squared that

522
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:14,590
appears in. All of the responses in the poll

523
00:50:14,590 --> 00:50:21,200
everywhere poll and then. The trick with the third

524
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:25,870
energy, which is. Why the.

525
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:32,640
Distractor example was in there. It is not

526
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:35,340
supposed to seem like that when I write.

527
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:40,890
The next lowest energy comes not from having.

528
00:50:43,050 --> 00:50:44,100
I should also say.

529
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:52,150
That there are several possible combinations of

530
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:55,720
that one unit of momentum that give the same

531
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:59,500
energy one one zero zero zero one zero and zero

532
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:03,190
zero one. I'll give that same general energy level

533
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:07,720
one unit. If we were to put that up to two zero

534
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:10,600
zero zero two zero zero zero two, we would have

535
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:13,660
four units. What we can also.

536
00:51:17,610 --> 00:51:22,650
Go to one one zero and end up with one plus one of

537
00:51:22,650 --> 00:51:27,510
two and the other two combinations as well, one

538
00:51:27,510 --> 00:51:31,760
zero one and zero one one. So permutations of that.

539
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:38,760
So those three lowest energies are zero one and

540
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:45,540
two times this constant result, which is now being

541
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:50,100
selected. So we'll pick up there on Thursday and

542
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:52,650
make sure to discuss the

543
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:56,700
contrast between distinguishable and

544
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:58,440
indistinguishable results on.

545
00:52:01,830 --> 00:52:10,500
Paige. Fifty four. And. All the rest of the week

546
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:16,110
for notes, so let me know. Now, if there are any

547
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:19,800
further questions about what we went through in

548
00:52:20,310 --> 00:52:21,030
today's.

549
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:26,260
Synchronous session in, otherwise, good luck with

550
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:30,310
the computing project, you know, I'll see you on

551
00:52:30,310 --> 00:52:32,830
Thursday, if not in office hours, starting in

552
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:34,470
about eight minutes.
