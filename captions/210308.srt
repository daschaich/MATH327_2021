1
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:07,360
So I expect some more people to come in as we go

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:12,790
on and I'll get the recording underway and go

3
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:17,410
through the usual routine that we've established

4
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:22,930
over the past month where. I'll start off by

5
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,440
asking you if there are any questions on the

6
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,280
asynchronous materials for last week or this week,

7
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:34,690
last week being the ideal gas law in this week,

8
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,840
applying that to thermodynamic cycles and wrapping

9
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,430
up the three weeks that we're spending on not

10
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:45,820
interacting systems in the canonical ensemble

11
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:48,960
before moving on to the grand canonical ensemble.

12
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,030
And there is also a the first part of the computer

13
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:57,250
project. A lot of those submissions look good.

14
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,770
They're being marked right now to get back to you

15
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,360
within the next week. And then the first homework

16
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:09,280
assignment is due a week from tomorrow. So.

17
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:15,940
Everything is in full swing, and I should have,

18
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:18,310
while going through that discussion of

19
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:24,520
the location we are in, the chorus I should have

20
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:31,070
brought up. The the end of the week, four notes,

21
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:34,780
the beginning of week five, which is where we left

22
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:38,680
off last time, with that transition from deriving

23
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:42,100
the ideal gas law as an example of an equation of

24
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:45,820
states to applying it to thermodynamic cycles,

25
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:49,840
processes in which we change the the macro state

26
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,920
of some system, it's pressure, volume, temperature,

27
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,460
entropy, internal energy, and can imagine

28
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:00,760
stringing together a sequence of such changes in

29
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:05,230
such a way that they all end up. Back at the

30
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:09,250
initial conditions and the processes, the sequence

31
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:12,400
can then be repeated over and over and over again

32
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,300
to make useful, interesting things happen.

33
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,230
So I'm just pausing for a moment to give you a

34
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:41,470
chance to type in questions, and I'll reiterate

35
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:45,460
that you're more than welcome to. Post them on,

36
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:48,040
zoom in the chat window or just speaking up, am

37
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:53,110
using yourself as well, and if no questions or

38
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:58,030
requests come in the next few seconds, I'll switch

39
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:02,800
over to asking you about some questions about the

40
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:08,050
material just to check the way that the concepts

41
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:10,640
are coming through well enough in the in the

42
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:17,070
asynchronous materials and build on them to to

43
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:20,290
show what all of this material is useful for.

44
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:54,850
So without further ado, I should have now

45
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,370
activated a

46
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,780
different question in the usual poll, looking at

47
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:12,370
the the ideal gas law and the application of the

48
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:16,210
ideal gas law to model the the actual atmosphere

49
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:18,550
of the Earth, which in round numbers is about 80

50
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:22,450
percent nitrogen and 20 percent oxygen. And the

51
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:28,330
ideal gas law is sufficient to let us relates the

52
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:32,230
overall pressure of the atmosphere to the pressure

53
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:38,430
of its individual. Components. I'll make sure that

54
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:40,500
those of you who have entered in the last few

55
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,550
minutes have that direct link to the poll, and

56
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:48,330
since this is not in the the lecture notes, the

57
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:51,330
asynchronous materials that you got beforehand,

58
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:55,620
I'll give you a few minutes to think about it and.

59
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:58,610
Judge your responses.

60
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:13,370
Let's see, we've got about a quarter of. The

61
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:19,110
participants responding so far so. If you just a

62
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:23,070
bit longer and summarize the the options here,

63
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:25,290
which maybe I should have done in the first place

64
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:27,510
to give you some more time to think about it, that.

65
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:32,710
Given these two gases forming the atmosphere of

66
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:36,790
the earth, you have four options for the overall

67
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,860
pressure of that atmosphere. The first just being

68
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:41,590
the average pressure of each of those. The

69
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,050
pressure of nitrogen, plus the pressure of oxygen

70
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:48,790
divided by two, where we can bring in information

71
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:52,660
about the relative abundance of nitrogen, oxygen

72
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:56,020
in the air. If it's 80 percent nitrogen, we might

73
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:59,230
expect the overall pressure to be consists of 80

74
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:02,800
percent of the pressure of nitrogen, plus 20

75
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,660
percent of the pressure of the oxygen. Or just the

76
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:14,350
the direct some of the pressure of nitrogen, plus

77
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:16,540
the pressure of oxygen giving the overall pressure

78
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:21,340
of the air, or the fourth option is that we might

79
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:23,830
imagine that the pressure of all the components is

80
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:27,850
equal both to the total pressure and also to each

81
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:30,490
other. That is, the the nitrogen in the air has an

82
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:33,280
equal pressure to the oxygen, which has an equal

83
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,020
pressure to its mixture.

84
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:31,510
Let's see the responses that have come in so far

85
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:38,860
are evenly split. If the page will load of.

86
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:43,670
Fifty percent saying that all the pressures should

87
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:46,760
be equal and another 50 percent saying that the

88
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,910
pressure should be proportional to the abundances.

89
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:55,880
And we'll ask you with this on the screen how we

90
00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:01,160
might use the ideal gas law to resolve this

91
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:05,480
disagreement and come up with a definitive

92
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:09,230
mathematical answer to this question.

93
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:20,380
Not hearing any volunteers, maybe I'll take a stab

94
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:25,270
at running through the application of the ideal

95
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:30,280
gas law to this case, let me find a nice piece of

96
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,480
margin to.

97
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:39,430
To put this where we have the ideal gas law

98
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:42,850
related to the pressure and volume of gas is to

99
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:46,300
the number of particles in that volume and their

100
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:51,250
temperature. So if we take this as input and

101
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:58,640
consider some. Volume of gas that has, you know,

102
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:06,500
80 percent nitrogen molecules and two and 20

103
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,160
percent.

104
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:14,980
Oxygen, then we can assume they have the same

105
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,820
temperature being in the same volume, and that

106
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,710
tells us that, say, the number of nitrogen

107
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:23,440
molecules is given by.

108
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:29,890
The pressure of that nitrogen times, that fixed

109
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:32,830
volume over that fixed temperature and similarly

110
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:35,440
for the oxygen,

111
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:43,420
and we know that the total number of particles is

112
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:46,270
going to be related to the total pressure of this

113
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:48,850
mixture, which we'll just call p the pressure with

114
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:53,200
no underscore. And it's also, I hope, intuitively

115
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:58,210
obvious that the total number of particles is the

116
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:02,830
sum of the number of each species, which she gives

117
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:03,460
us then.

118
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:09,880
He and finds that the poverty and oxygen times

119
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,790
that fixed the poverty, which we can cancel out

120
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:17,740
and get the result that the total pressure is the

121
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:21,010
sum of what I call the two partial pressures,

122
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:27,800
which hopefully was an option in the. A poll that

123
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,200
we just had here.

124
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:34,170
Of.

125
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:42,790
And this is one of the relations that was

126
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,540
mentioned in the historical context at the very

127
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:49,570
end of this week's notes, that a lot of these

128
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:54,160
so-called thermodynamic thermodynamic relations

129
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,810
between the macro state properties of the system,

130
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:01,990
pressure, volume, temperature and number of

131
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:05,290
particles were empirically observed even as far

132
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:10,120
back as the sixteen hundreds, well before the

133
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:13,990
development of the ideal gas law or understanding

134
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:19,330
of the statistical and atomic or molecular basis

135
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,600
of all of these emergent thermodynamic properties.

136
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:27,700
In this result that the pressure of the mixture is

137
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,910
equal to this, some of the pressures of all of the

138
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:36,250
individual components of that mixture was another

139
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,520
one of those empirical relations discovered before

140
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:43,090
the ideal gas was formulated, and in particular

141
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:47,440
during the the growth of industry in the late

142
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,960
seventeen hundreds and into the eighteen hundreds

143
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:52,180
in Europe. It is.

144
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:59,250
Become known as Dalton's law of partial pressures,

145
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:02,070
the partial pressure being.

146
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:07,890
The pressure of each component of the gas, the

147
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:12,180
nitrogen and the oxygen in this case and published,

148
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:15,150
I believe, around 18 won a couple of decades

149
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:21,970
before the ideal gas law itself. And as we saw, it

150
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:26,490
comes directly out of the ideal gas law relating

151
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:28,830
the pressure to the particle number, which is

152
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:31,410
something that we are more familiar with

153
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:38,000
adding. Adding up just linearly with No.

154
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,950
No need for detail considerations of how much of

155
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:50,820
each species is present, the less of a of the

156
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,100
fewer particles of the species there are, the less

157
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:56,430
pressure there is. And that accounts for the

158
00:15:56,430 --> 00:16:04,850
abundance in this direct some. So let me go back

159
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:07,970
and we'll ask if there are any.

160
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:13,720
Questions about that derivation and explanation

161
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:18,920
before I move on to. To the next question that

162
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:23,110
will transition. Out of last week and into the

163
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:27,300
coming weeks material. And I know we are right at

164
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:32,610
the start of the week, so I'll try. Not to assume

165
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:36,660
you've gone through the entirety of the week five

166
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:39,390
notes through the nemec cycles in advance. We'll

167
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:45,210
see if we can stick to the first half of that and

168
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:45,540
the.

169
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:48,800
First.

170
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,080
Question that I am.

171
00:16:56,350 --> 00:17:01,390
Activating now on this poll should be up is

172
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:07,210
actually tying together all three of the the weeks

173
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:10,390
that we are working on the canonical ensemble and

174
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:14,800
its application to ideal gas's, first in general

175
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:19,480
and then ideally gas's in thermodynamic cycles. So

176
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:23,650
just to give some background to this question. Can.

177
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:31,700
Look back to. Our lecture notes from week three

178
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:35,510
introducing the canonical ensemble where we

179
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:40,530
introduce this heat capacity as the. The response

180
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:43,890
of the internal energy with with respect to a

181
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:48,510
change in the temperature and we mentioned in a

182
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:52,470
footnote that the subscripts V on this severe heat

183
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:57,300
capacity refers to the fact that this particular

184
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:02,760
form of the heat capacity is assuming that the

185
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:06,750
volume of our system is kept fixed. This is the

186
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:09,090
heat capacity at constant volume.

187
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,850
And we mentioned that we hadn't yet considered the

188
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:20,000
role of the volume in. The heat and the internal

189
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,920
energy which was coming up in the the first

190
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:29,840
section of the ideal gas materials where we

191
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:33,860
related the volume of the container holding that

192
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:36,800
gas to the possible energy levels that could

193
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:44,180
occupy and thereby to the properties of the. The

194
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,460
system and.

195
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:54,190
The tablet is. Feeling a bit twitchy, but now we

196
00:18:54,190 --> 00:19:01,000
are looking at the the first few pages of the

197
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,670
notes for the week starting today.

198
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:08,690
Where? We are.

199
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:14,490
Drawing a distinction between two possible ways of

200
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:19,440
changing the internal energy and the temperature

201
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:24,200
of an ideal gas in a particular volume, and we

202
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:30,500
have we saw in this. First section, that's the

203
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:34,550
work that is done on the gas by, say, compressing

204
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:40,400
its volume, applying some external force to move a

205
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,430
piston that forms one wall of its container, for

206
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:48,110
example, is only identified with the overall

207
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:52,070
change in internal energy when the entropy is

208
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:54,440
constant, when we are considering an adiabatic

209
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:59,510
process and more generally, there are two possible

210
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:04,940
contributions that can be made to that internal

211
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:09,300
energy which we identify with. On the one hand

212
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:12,740
that working, on the other hand, the flow of heat,

213
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:16,220
a change in the temperature of the gas without

214
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:19,910
changing its volume so that both the volume and

215
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:25,730
particle number are kept constant when heat is

216
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:26,300
flowing.

217
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:31,510
There's what I really wanted to underline, that

218
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:33,580
when the volume is constant, there is no

219
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:39,040
mechanical work done and the change in energy is

220
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:42,280
exactly the change in heat. And this connects us

221
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:48,820
to that constant volume heat capacity that we had

222
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:50,680
back in week three.

223
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:56,050
World now decorate it with a reminder that the

224
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:59,830
volume is kept fixed when we take the partial

225
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:01,360
derivative of the energy with respect to

226
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,990
temperature and because the volume is fixed, we

227
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:11,110
have this connection. That's the change in energy.

228
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:17,090
Is exactly the heat, which gives us, of course,

229
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:20,570
the the terminology for this quantity as a heat

230
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:23,990
capacity rather than the temperature dependence of

231
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:29,540
the energy. And that is all a prelude to looking

232
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:34,690
at the more general situation where. We may allow

233
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:39,700
both the energy and the entropy to change, and the

234
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:42,760
more general change in energy then

235
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:50,360
is the some. Of both that heat and the the work

236
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:54,020
that is done by the change in volume. So if you

237
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:56,960
want to look at the.

238
00:21:59,030 --> 00:21:59,900
The overall.

239
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:08,520
Heat in this context, I'm not sure why the tablet

240
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:13,340
is being very slow to respond. At the moment.

241
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:20,490
Hopefully it's settled down now of this relation

242
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:21,270
tells us.

243
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:30,010
If you will wake up that the heat whose capacity

244
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:34,450
we want to define is in this more general

245
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:40,930
situation, not only the change in the energy, but

246
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:42,760
the difference between the change in the energy

247
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,020
and the work that is done,

248
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:53,290
where that work we saw in that first section and

249
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:57,010
I'll put a reminder here, was the negative of the

250
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,840
pressure times, the change in volume. So if the

251
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,470
volume is compressed, the volume is reduced. We

252
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:09,430
get a positive amount of work done on our system

253
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:16,180
by that process. And this relation between the.

254
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:19,350
Heat energy and work.

255
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:28,230
Motivates the definition of a an alternative heat

256
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:30,720
capacity, which is the one being asked about in

257
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,490
the poll now. Which is the heat capacity at

258
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:37,450
constant pressure rather than constant volume

259
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:42,310
where. No longer imposing a constant volume, the

260
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:45,140
there may be a non-zero heat, so we have to keep

261
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:50,210
track of both the sensitivity of the internal

262
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:55,740
energy to the temperature, constant pressure. Plus,

263
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:57,240
the.

264
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:05,180
And that w, of course, was a very. Plus, the

265
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:10,280
change in the volume with that change in

266
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:13,130
temperature again and a constant pressure, so

267
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:14,660
we've seen that.

268
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:22,520
Or we've discussed that if we heat up a an ideal

269
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:25,640
gas with, say, a constant force applied.

270
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:33,390
To that movable piston in the in the diagram we

271
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:37,380
just looked at earlier, as that gas is heated up,

272
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:41,160
its pressure will change. It will be able to push

273
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:46,290
out that piston and increase the volume just as a

274
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:50,340
consequence of adding energy, adding heat to

275
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:53,250
increase its temperature. So that is the

276
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:56,910
background for the question being asked here,

277
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:58,650
which is cycling back to

278
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:07,050
connect all three weeks material on the. The

279
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:10,440
canonical ensemble leading the heat capacity now

280
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:14,340
it and pressure, rather than cast a volume to the

281
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:17,580
ideal gases and particles and to the relation

282
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:24,540
between. Heat and work and energy. And I have.

283
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:32,120
Rambled on for a while to to get that all set up

284
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,610
for you to consider. So I will now shut up for a

285
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:36,860
few minutes and let you consider

286
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:42,470
how you would answer this question about the

287
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:46,250
constant pressure, heat capacity on the basis of

288
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:48,980
this equation written in the margins here, which I

289
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:53,120
hope is is legible. And let me know if it is not

290
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:57,230
or if any of the build up to this question. Was

291
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:57,860
not clear.

292
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:31,460
Let's see, about a quarter of responses have come

293
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:36,620
in, so another minute or two for those who are

294
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:39,320
still. Working on this.

295
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,030
And at this point.

296
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:39,370
I can get to the responses I see.

297
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:48,960
Not unanimity, but a preference for five here. So

298
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:54,870
just quickly confirm that, that if we conveniently

299
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:58,020
have the expression for the energy sitting right

300
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:00,060
here so we can plug in.

301
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,150
The derivative of that with respect to the

302
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:07,450
temperature, just the same at counterpressure and

303
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:13,000
at constant volume, so that three halves in was

304
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,060
the constant volume heat capacity we looked at

305
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:23,480
last week and then from the ideal gas. We have the

306
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:28,570
expression for. The volume in terms of the number

307
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:30,640
of particles, their temperature and the pressure,

308
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:35,950
so plugging that in to this derivative up here,

309
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:40,390
take the derivative with respect to t, it just

310
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:44,830
gets rid of that linear T. We have a P times and

311
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:49,780
over P and then a five has. And they're.

312
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:56,790
And I'll just ask for questions or concerns about

313
00:30:57,060 --> 00:31:01,790
that little derivation. While I move on to the

314
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:11,780
next. And maybe recentre. This page. So all of it

315
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:13,760
is is visible.

316
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:18,810
Down there.

317
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:44,360
And let's see,

318
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:50,030
the next question is up, and this is asking about.

319
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:51,880
The.

320
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:59,790
The relation between idiomatic expansion and heats,

321
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:02,910
which comes up at a similar point in the notes

322
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:03,990
that I'll just review.

323
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:10,050
To give you a chance to think about this question,

324
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:16,050
where? We saw that we earlier defined in the

325
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:19,170
previous weeks work adiabatic processes to be

326
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:25,560
those where the Entropia. Is unchanged, and we saw

327
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:29,340
in this equation 65 there any change in the

328
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:33,780
entropy corresponds to the heat that is either

329
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:39,450
flowing into or flowing out of. Our our system as

330
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:41,520
it is manipulated.

331
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:50,770
And then changed in this process. And.

332
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:58,570
A way to understand this a bit more intuitively or

333
00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:03,640
at least physically, is by saying that this

334
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:07,240
exchange of heat takes some time in which to occur

335
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:10,240
more or less time, depending on how isolated the

336
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,060
system is from its environments. But the faster

337
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:17,590
the process is carried out, the less time there is

338
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:21,670
for heat to be exchanged with its surroundings and

339
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:27,280
the less chance there is then for entropy to to be

340
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:30,460
created either in the system or its surroundings

341
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:34,210
through that flow of heat, which gives us the

342
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:39,940
intuition that adiabatic processes are fast while

343
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:42,190
the exchange of heat.

344
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,750
Requires that the process be a bit slower and real

345
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:53,600
processes typically are closer to the idiomatic

346
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,870
extreme than the extreme, where there is enough

347
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:59,780
fluid, the maximum amount of heat flows at every

348
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:03,350
stage of the process to keep the temperature fixed.

349
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:07,850
Where isothermal. And the question that I put up

350
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:15,260
here is to consider. Two identical systems. Like

351
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:19,110
that. Container with the piston. We had a picture

352
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:22,170
of and consider pulling out that piston to double

353
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:25,050
the volume of each in one case quickly so that

354
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:28,800
it's an adiabatic process and the other case not

355
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,620
quite so quickly, so that there is at least some

356
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:35,880
in flowing heat from the external surroundings

357
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:38,850
with which the system is initially in equilibrium.

358
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:42,690
So just to draw a.

359
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:46,140
Picture of that.

360
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:53,140
Taking advantage of.

361
00:34:55,570 --> 00:35:01,150
This picture here, we start off with two of these

362
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:04,490
systems. And.

363
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:11,720
Approximately double their size one, idiomatically,

364
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:13,050
no heat flowing.

365
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:18,050
And the second, allowing some heat to enter from

366
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:21,830
the environment, both of these systems started off

367
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:25,190
with the same pressure of volume, temperature and

368
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:26,060
particle number.

369
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:32,070
And you can call the final pressures P1 and P2,

370
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:36,030
and the question is, what is the relation between

371
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:42,000
those pressures? Is P1 greater than P2, less than

372
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:47,890
pizza, or are they equal? Depending on how much

373
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:52,360
heat is or how much heat is, zero or non-zero

374
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:57,340
amount is able to flow into the system as it is

375
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:58,090
expanding.

376
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:09,240
I'll give you a minute or two or two to think

377
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,530
about that.

378
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:24,810
One response has already come in

379
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:30,030
while I was going through the set up.

380
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:06,210
And in this case, with multiple responses coming

381
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:09,480
in, we do have.

382
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:17,410
A consensus that. The the pressure is smaller

383
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:20,030
after adiabatic expansion and larger with heat

384
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:23,160
entering. There are a few ways you might have

385
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:31,100
gotten to that. Conclusion. First by. Noting from

386
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:34,430
the ideal gas law that he entering the system is

387
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:37,280
going to increase its temperature and thereby

388
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:42,950
increase its pressure, so any kid that is allowed

389
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:45,860
to exchange will pump up the temperature of the

390
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,690
amount of energy in the gas and thereby adds

391
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:53,270
pressure or could have jumped ahead to these

392
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:56,480
pressure volume diagrams. And in particular, the

393
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:03,650
second one shows that the adiabatic. Compression

394
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:05,120
and expansion is.

395
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:10,940
Taking us, just as I said, between two different

396
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:14,950
temperatures. One with the higher pressure, one

397
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:19,390
with a lower pressure, so identifying this, you

398
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:22,360
know, reversing the arrows on these lines to look

399
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:25,360
at expansion rather than compression can see that

400
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:28,870
in the extreme case of no heat exchange, the

401
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:30,010
pressure ends up.

402
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:40,210
Higher than in the. The resulting pressure. Coming

403
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:44,400
out of that adiabatic expansion. And perhaps I

404
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,130
should back up and just.

405
00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:53,240
Motivates these this pressure building diagram of

406
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:56,960
it in the you know, the last bit of today's

407
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:01,070
meeting. This is a useful way of representing that

408
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:05,690
overall macro status of its limbic system, given

409
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:10,670
that the if we fixed the number of particles and

410
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:14,470
then the pressure and volume. Together determine.

411
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:17,740
The the temperature.

412
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:26,420
The temperature, in turn determines the internal

413
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:26,990
energy.

414
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:36,970
And the entropy can also be found from the flow of

415
00:41:36,970 --> 00:41:39,490
heat and work in these processes, work being

416
00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:42,790
related to the volume and pressure plotted on

417
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:45,160
these diagrams. So

418
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:47,980
the last.

419
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:56,300
Activity we'll talk about today is just. Check in

420
00:41:56,300 --> 00:42:01,030
with one of the the first gaps that were in the

421
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:04,970
written materials this week asking about the

422
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:07,850
change in temperature and change in the pressure

423
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:16,110
from this adiabatic process. Shown here and in the

424
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:18,810
interest of time, maybe I'll ask you just to.

425
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:27,140
Check out the change in that pressure, which

426
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:33,090
should now be activated. On that pole everywhere

427
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,410
here.

428
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:44,500
And while you're thinking I can mention or make

429
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:51,100
explicit the terminology that the the line on that

430
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:54,430
pressure volume diagram for an adiabatic process

431
00:42:54,790 --> 00:43:01,120
is known as an idea that whereas the corresponding

432
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,970
line for an isothermal process is known as the

433
00:43:03,970 --> 00:43:08,140
nisso thurm, essentially turning adjectives into

434
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:08,860
nouns.

435
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:16,320
In a way that may not be the most elegant, but is

436
00:43:16,770 --> 00:43:22,110
reasonably widespread. So some responses coming in

437
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:27,780
of a couple of minutes to for the rest of you to

438
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:31,140
consider that in particular, those who might not

439
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:35,100
have gotten to this in advance of Monday morning.

440
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:17,870
Now, only one response so far may be.

441
00:46:21,970 --> 00:46:24,220
Getting worn out at the end of the session, so

442
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:27,630
I'll just go through the calculation quickly.

443
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:34,390
This tablet is able to get a little less twitchy

444
00:46:35,170 --> 00:46:39,400
where all we need to do is start from the given

445
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:42,640
information that due to the constant entropy. This

446
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:46,210
particular combination of volume and temperature

447
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:51,260
is constant. And in particular, in the terminology

448
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:53,000
of this plot with

449
00:46:55,730 --> 00:47:00,710
T notes and P not going to be final in P final.

450
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:10,170
Lake Constance, the key to the three halves of

451
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:16,250
that statement, which is the same as saying that

452
00:47:16,850 --> 00:47:19,820
the volumes of the two thirds times the

453
00:47:19,820 --> 00:47:26,300
temperature is constant and plugging in the.

454
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:34,530
Temperature in terms of the ideal gas law. TV over

455
00:47:34,530 --> 00:47:36,930
and over again is fixed, but the pressure and

456
00:47:36,930 --> 00:47:37,530
volume.

457
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:44,100
P and V. Are able to change.

458
00:47:48,890 --> 00:47:51,530
You can see that.

459
00:47:54,170 --> 00:47:55,430
Canceling out the ends.

460
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:07,940
He told the not to the. Five thirds is fixed.

461
00:48:11,510 --> 00:48:16,010
So that Diltz happy. Defined as the final minus

462
00:48:16,010 --> 00:48:18,200
initial is.

463
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:26,390
The ratio dividing through both sides by that

464
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:31,660
violence of the five thirds minus one. Which was

465
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:36,880
indeed the option that was preferred.

466
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:46,480
So that brings us to the end of time. I will leave

467
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:50,980
that up in case I went through the algebraic

468
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:55,390
manipulations a bit quickly and leave the

469
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:58,270
recording running just a little while longer in

470
00:48:58,270 --> 00:49:01,960
case any of you have any final questions here at

471
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:06,940
the end. If not, we will pick up on Thursday with

472
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:10,180
the remainder of thermodynamics cycles and the

473
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:15,920
last bit of. Our focus on the canonical ensemble

474
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:18,080
before moving into the grand canonical ensemble

475
00:49:18,470 --> 00:49:24,140
and also be back in this TSOU meeting in about 10

476
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:27,980
minutes for office hours, I'll have to shut down

477
00:49:28,010 --> 00:49:31,340
before then to get the recording saved and started

478
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:31,880
back up.

479
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,240
That is it for me today.
