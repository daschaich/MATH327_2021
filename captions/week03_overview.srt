00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,320
Hello and welcome back to statistical physics

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:07,680
this week three overview video on the canonical

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,970
ensemble. And before getting into that overview,

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:16,620
just a brief logistical note. Over the past few

5
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:19,440
days, I've been experimenting with these

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,730
recordings and I believe I found a way to reduce

7
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,240
the file size by roughly a factor of five with

8
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,740
only a modest decrease in the video quality. So

9
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:35,460
that's what I'm trying now. And I want you to let

10
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,810
me know if the quality decrease is more sufficient

11
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:44,610
or more severe than it seems to me. And any issues

12
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:49,470
are arising that would motivate going back to the

13
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:55,950
larger size recordings, but moving on to the

14
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:00,390
actual content for this week, the canonical

15
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:03,750
ensemble is the second of three statistical

16
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,240
ensembles we will be looking at in this module. So

17
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,860
we only spent one week on micro canonical ensemble

18
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:14,940
last week and have moved straight on to the

19
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:19,550
canonical ensemble, in part related to some

20
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,380
something I emphasized in last week's videos that

21
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,500
the micro canonical ensemble, while it features

22
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:31,040
this fundamental connection to the. Conserve

23
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,270
energy that is conserve by the first law of

24
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:39,530
thermodynamics. This requires imagining systems

25
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:41,990
that are completely isolated from the rest of the

26
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:47,600
universe, which is not very realistic or relevant,

27
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:50,030
not the sort of problems that we want to apply

28
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:53,660
statistical physics to analyze and solve. So the

29
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:57,620
canonical ensemble gets around this by fixing the

30
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:02,330
temperature. Instead of imposing conservation of

31
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:05,630
energy directly on the system being analyzed, the

32
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:09,530
idea here is that the system we're looking at is

33
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:12,230
in thermal contact. It's allowed to exchange

34
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:19,320
energy with a large thermal reservoir. So. Some

35
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:23,160
other much larger system that sets the temperature

36
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,440
that is then picked up by the system that we are

37
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,340
studying so that the temperature can be considered

38
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,550
fixed for the energy of the system is allowed to

39
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:35,520
fluctuate while still conserving the overall

40
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,300
energy of the universe through exchanging energy

41
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:43,560
with this surrounding or external thermal

42
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,610
reservoir that it is in contact with. And a big

43
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:51,750
part of the lecture notes for this week consist of

44
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:55,680
putting that basic idea on a more rigorous

45
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,410
mathematical framework. You know, highlight some

46
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:01,950
of the key features of that in the the wrap up

47
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:04,560
overview video at the end of the week, rather than

48
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,550
here at the overview,

49
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:13,500
will say that part of this process introduces a

50
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:16,770
very important quantity known as the partition

51
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:22,560
function, which. In essence, it is the the

52
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,720
canonical ensemble that contains all of the

53
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:30,630
information about the probability space with this

54
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:34,050
constraint of a fixed temperature and the Kanala

55
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:36,150
and the partition function for the canonical

56
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,850
ensemble itself can be.

57
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:45,650
Replaced by or is equivalent to a related quantity

58
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:48,410
with the dimensions of energy that is known as the

59
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:55,820
Helmholtz free energy. This is the logarithm of

60
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:58,490
the partition function. Times the temperature will

61
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:01,370
pop up in the lecture notes and the only

62
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:04,220
motivation for swapping back and forth between the

63
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:07,220
partition function and the Helmholtz free energy

64
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:11,420
is just sort of ease of calculations and notation

65
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,950
as we derive quantities and analyze systems based

66
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:19,730
on this canonical ensemble. And maybe I should

67
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:23,210
reiterate, the basic idea of statistical ensembles

68
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:26,930
obviously will be reusing some of those concepts

69
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:29,090
that were developed last week and the micro

70
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:34,220
canonical context where these statistical ensemble

71
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:39,260
is a physical system and that evolves through time

72
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:42,080
probabilistically sampling the possible

73
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,500
microstates that it's microscopic degrees of

74
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:50,910
freedom can can realize. And subject to the

75
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:53,700
certain constraints which now for the canonical

76
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:58,200
ensemble are the six temperature as well as the

77
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,230
conserved particle number that we also had for the

78
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:05,400
canonical ensemble last week. So the big

79
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,400
difference going from micro, canonical to

80
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,530
canonical is that. Now, instead of the temperature

81
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,800
being a derived quantity based on the conserved

82
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,300
energy, which was the situation for the micro

83
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,770
canonical ensemble in the canonical ensemble, we

84
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:26,040
have the energy of the system or the average

85
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:29,940
energy, the expectation value that is a derived

86
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:33,270
quantity based on the fixed temperature that's set

87
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:37,170
by the large thermal reservoir. In both cases, the

88
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:42,720
entropy is another derived quantity, and we'll go

89
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,180
through that a bit more rapidly this week. Having

90
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:48,120
gotten an introduction to the concept of entropy

91
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:52,050
last week in the microRNA canonical context, and

92
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:57,240
one other derived quantity that we look at here is

93
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,090
known as the heat capacity, which basically

94
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:07,080
dictates how the energy of Earth or the average

95
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,390
internal energy of the system depends on the

96
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:11,550
temperature. Just as we looked at in the

97
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:14,010
microeconomics case last week, the temperature

98
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:19,170
depended on the energy and in agreement. Well. We

99
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:22,110
get the expected results, which I will revisit and

100
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:26,640
save for the wrap up overview video at the end of

101
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,120
the week,

102
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:35,820
the last section of this week's lecture notes is a

103
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,740
detailed investigation of a first application of

104
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:44,520
the canonical ensemble, which is focusing on the.

105
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:48,320
The same sort of spin systems that we introduced

106
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,770
last week, that simplest possible mathematics of

107
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:54,860
degrees of freedom that can take one of two

108
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:59,690
possible values, either aligned with a magnetic

109
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:02,570
field that is externally applied or aligned

110
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:09,050
against it. So the mathematics is. Very similar to

111
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:11,360
that of flipping a coin. But at the same time, we

112
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,530
can define the energy and temperature and entropy

113
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:20,780
for this system. In this last subsection of the

114
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:24,230
lecture notes for this week, we look at the.

115
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:28,810
Physically observable effects that result,

116
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,000
depending on how much information is knowable

117
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:38,440
about the spin system we consider. So we look at

118
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:42,970
two distinct cases, one in which we have a bunch

119
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:46,120
of spins and we can distinguish between them. We

120
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,630
can tell them apart. And then the the realization.

121
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,450
Focus on here, we suppose that the spin's are

122
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:57,330
embedded in some solid material, so they have a

123
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:01,650
definite position and we know that a spin can be

124
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:04,710
distinguished by looking at each individual

125
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:05,310
position.

126
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:12,470
And we contrast this with the case of now that

127
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:16,570
same bunch of Stenz that's no longer embedded with

128
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,340
a fixed position for a spin, but the spins are

129
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:22,070
allowed to sort of mix together because they don't

130
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:24,470
interact. They can even overlap with each other

131
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:30,620
and occupy the the same points in space so that

132
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:34,640
there's no way of knowing by any method.

133
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:40,490
Which spin we we might be looking at when we try

134
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:44,960
to measure or observe any individual features of

135
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:50,880
them, so. The information of distinguishing

136
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,730
between the various spins, knowing which spin we

137
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:56,700
are looking at is something intrinsic to the

138
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:01,080
system, it's not a matter of practicality whether

139
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,410
we are sufficiently clever to measure this

140
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:07,590
information in a given realization of the spin

141
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:13,380
system. It's really something that is intrinsic to

142
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:18,550
the system itself and depending on. That different

143
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:22,060
amount of information in the system, we will see

144
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,130
as we go through the notes in some detail.

145
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:30,600
That's predictions for physically observable

146
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,200
quantities differ depending on the information in

147
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:39,740
the system, so information is physical. In this

148
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:43,160
context, and that has many far reaching

149
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,820
implications that remain at the forefront of

150
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,760
modern day research. One example you might have

151
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:54,260
heard of being the black hole information paradox,

152
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:59,990
which is dealing with the same sort of issues, the

153
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:02,840
physically observable consequences of what

154
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:07,580
information can in principle be determined about a

155
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:11,150
statistical system, though in the black hole case,

156
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:15,320
this involves quantum mechanics and the general

157
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,260
relativistic theory of gravity. So that's why

158
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:21,830
we're looking at our usual spin system as the

159
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:26,090
example we consider in this module the first

160
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:29,900
example of the canonical approach which we will

161
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:34,760
follow in the next couple of weeks by applying the

162
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:39,350
canonical approach to ideal gases and

163
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:42,320
thermodynamic cycles. But before that, I will be

164
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,650
back with a wrap up video for this week

165
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:49,220
summarizing the highlights after you've gone

166
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:51,230
through those lecture notes.
