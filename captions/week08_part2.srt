00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:05,010
Hello and welcome back to Statistical Physics.

2
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:09,320
This is the second video for week eight, wrapping

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:13,790
up our brief summary of the context, motivations

4
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:17,510
and Kilani outcomes of this week's material on

5
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:21,380
quantum gases of bosun's analyzed in the grand

6
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:25,610
canonical ensemble. So let's bring up that

7
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:28,880
material back onto the screen. Picking up where

8
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,810
the previous part of the summary left off at the

9
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:40,160
grand canonical potential for the photon gas as a

10
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:44,420
specific realization of a quantum gas of bosons

11
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:48,980
where the particular protons we consider photons,

12
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:53,660
particles of light are relativistic and defined by

13
00:00:54,380 --> 00:01:00,350
the frequency of the wavelength of the particles,

14
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:06,280
the photons that relates how. The energy levels

15
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:11,050
depend on the quantize momentum in the system and

16
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:13,750
all of that is to say that's the answer. That's

17
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:16,000
where the conjecture that we have adopted in the

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,420
hopes of gaining a system that would be

19
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:24,120
interesting to analyze with the statistical tools

20
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:28,450
that we have developed in the next section is

21
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,290
demonstrating just how interesting those analyses

22
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:38,020
can be by seeing that the resulting mathematical

23
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:41,500
model coming from the simple ideal, not

24
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,980
interacting of photons provides really an

25
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:50,380
excellent description of. Real physical systems in

26
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:53,800
the universe, ranging from some of the hottest

27
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,890
locations like the surface of the Sun and other

28
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:59,740
stars to some of the coldest locations in the

29
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:04,420
universe, the intergalactic voids that are not

30
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:09,400
quite empty space, but instead permeated by a very

31
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,400
low temperature gas of photons known as the cosmic

32
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,790
microwave background. In the both of those cases,

33
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:20,040
the information that we have available from

34
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,510
observations that we can.

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,690
Compare with the mathematical model we're

36
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:34,670
developing is measurement through satellites,

37
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:36,980
observatories, telescopes and other tools,

38
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:41,120
measurement of how many photons, how much light

39
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,230
arrives with a particular frequency. That is, we

40
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:50,800
have access to. The integration in this expression

41
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:56,200
that ends up over all frequencies to the average

42
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,170
energy density for the photon gas. That is being

43
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:06,170
measured. In practice, frequency by frequency,

44
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:13,070
by doing a quick calculation through a gap.

45
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,380
We find that the ideal not attracting and gas, the

46
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:23,550
photons produces this expression for the.

47
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:29,550
Essentially, the energy density per unit frequency

48
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,640
as a function of that frequency, Omega, which is

49
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,360
known as the Planck spectrum and is shown in this

50
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,050
figure here for three temperatures of a few

51
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:41,100
thousand Kelvin.

52
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,150
Plotted here versus the wavelength rather than the

53
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:51,360
frequency. And compared to the classical

54
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,720
prediction for the energy density or in this case,

55
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:04,440
the the power of light. Which from our work last

56
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,950
week, connecting quantum statistics to the high

57
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:10,920
temperature of temperature, classical RÃ©gine, we

58
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:16,070
expect to come into agreements in. The high

59
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:19,030
temperature classical regime where quantum in

60
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:23,890
classical physics should coincide. A further

61
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:26,260
calculation.

62
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:36,550
Allows us to confirm that at high temperatures and

63
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:37,690
this factor here.

64
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,440
Beta is approximately zero at high temperatures

65
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:46,930
this. Denominator that cancels out to leading

66
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:49,600
order and leaves just an overall one over

67
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,850
wavelengths of the fourth dependence in the power

68
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:57,100
spectrum. This is the classical result plotted up

69
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:03,490
here that we see agrees with the quantum result at

70
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:06,070
large wavelengths, which is known as the infrared

71
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:10,450
regime, but disagrees enormously, in fact,

72
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:14,380
infinitely in the limit of high energies, short

73
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:18,400
wavelengths known as the ultraviolet. And this

74
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:24,880
breakdown between. The classical prediction and

75
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,800
actual observations like that shown in this plot

76
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,130
of the solar radiation that reaches the earth,

77
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:36,910
which drops down to zero as the wavelength gets

78
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:39,820
smaller, the ultraviolet, rather than diverging

79
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:42,940
towards the infinite energy predicted classically

80
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:47,950
that was known as the ultraviolet catastrophe and

81
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:52,360
was the motivation for Max Planck more than 100

82
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:58,470
years ago to heuristically develop the. Spectrum

83
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:03,420
we are studying that we have now derived from the

84
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:06,420
first principles of quantum statistics rather than

85
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:11,100
a heuristic argument and shown as illustrated in

86
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,700
this figure, very good agreement with the real

87
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:18,210
physical system of the radiation, the light

88
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:22,220
emitted by our sun. Despite the fact that we have

89
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:25,700
assumed the particles we are working with are

90
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:28,430
completely not interacting and.

91
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,800
Do not have any influence on each other, which

92
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:37,970
could in principle be a severe assumption or

93
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:42,440
approximation, but turns out to allow a very good

94
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:48,590
reconstruction or model of the energy density

95
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,430
released by the sun that reaches us here on Earth

96
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:56,420
and moving from that high temperature regime of

97
00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:00,170
the sun to the cold temperature regime of not

98
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:04,730
quite empty intergalactic space observations done

99
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:08,240
more recently by satellites have produced this

100
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,340
sort of picture, which is looking at the full sky.

101
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:20,200
Using measurements of that same energy spectrum,

102
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:25,690
the energy density as per unit frequency to define

103
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:31,170
a temperature point by point in the sky. And then

104
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:34,200
color small fluctuations about that temperature,

105
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,470
either red or blue, depending on whether they are

106
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:41,160
hotter or colder than average respectively, where

107
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:42,870
the scale of fluctuations.

108
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:51,120
Is on the scale of nearly killed in thousands of

109
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:53,880
of Kelvyn.

110
00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:00,090
The red regions are about point zero zero zero two

111
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:03,720
Kelvin, hotter than the cool ones and an example,

112
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:07,190
reconstruction of that temperature from the

113
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:10,590
measured photon spectrum is shown here in this

114
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:17,400
figure that's led to a Nobel Prize 15 years ago

115
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:23,880
where the energy emitted by that cosmic microwave

116
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:27,660
background permeating intergalactic space was

117
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:31,740
measured as a function of frequency, giving the

118
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:36,990
empty squares here the size of which roughly

119
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:40,350
indicates fairly cautious estimates of

120
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:45,080
uncertainties and are fit to precisely the blank

121
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:48,750
spectrum that we have derived in this module,

122
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:52,620
predicting in this case a temperature of about two

123
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,500
point seven Kelvin, which was confirmed by

124
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,520
subsequent measurements with the following

125
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:05,170
generations of satellites. So even though our

126
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:09,310
derivation of the blank spectrum relied on making

127
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:13,820
the assumption that. The particles we are working

128
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,770
with are ideal in the sense that they don't

129
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:19,870
interact with each other. We end up with a truly

130
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:23,200
excellent mathematical models for these real

131
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,220
physical systems, and these are, of course, not.

132
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,060
Not the only places where our work is applicable

133
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:38,020
to the real world, similar spectrums of radiation

134
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:42,980
are coming out of your oven and. Out of everything

135
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:46,910
else, emitting light and heat and other forms of.

136
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:53,990
Of radiation. So with that.

137
00:09:56,390 --> 00:10:00,680
With those examples out of the way, we can wrap up

138
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:05,090
for this week by. Doing a few more quick

139
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:08,720
calculations based on the technical potential

140
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:12,440
computing, some of the other large scale

141
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:17,060
thermodynamic properties of the photon gas from

142
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:21,200
that fundamental defining quantity and putting

143
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,020
them together to come up with the equation of

144
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:29,420
states describing the relations between those

145
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:33,110
those quantities, the fresher, average internal

146
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:37,400
energy, average particle number and entropy just

147
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:41,690
in the same way that we did for the canonical

148
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:45,140
ensemble and the classical non relativistic ideal

149
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:49,580
gases back before the term break. And all this is

150
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:52,990
is the the same sort of derivatives of the great

151
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,020
canonical potential.

152
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:01,960
Being applied to determine the average particle,

153
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:05,530
no, in addition to the average internal energy

154
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:06,400
that we looked at.

155
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:13,560
To determine that blank spectrum, followed by the

156
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:18,690
entropy and using the entropy and in particular

157
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:22,140
the condition of constant entropy to determine the

158
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,710
radiation pressure of the photon gas, we can put

159
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:30,870
everything together. Define the same sort of

160
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:35,040
relations that we saw in the classical non

161
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,730
relativistic case of an ideal gas, that the

162
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:43,260
average internal energy is related to the average

163
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,900
particle number of times the temperature that can

164
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:51,720
be done. Relativistic case equation 50 for this

165
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:58,370
relation was. A somewhat simpler equals three has

166
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:03,500
a.. That was a very useful relation when analyzing

167
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:07,610
it in cycles here, the numerical factor is a bit

168
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:11,180
more complicated coming from just the details of

169
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:15,010
how the energy's depend on the quantized momentum.

170
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:20,570
And the story is similar for the equation of state

171
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:25,190
relating the pressure volume particle, no

172
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:29,630
temperature or possibly the energy that just like

173
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:34,820
the ideal gas law, PV equals A.. We have the same

174
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:38,540
functional form with just a different numerical

175
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:45,250
factor in front. So in that sense, the. The

176
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:51,010
quantum gas of photons is behaving similarly to

177
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:55,240
the the more familiar, more everyday ideal gases

178
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,520
that we have already considered with.

179
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:04,160
On the other hand, we look at not the large scale

180
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,830
thermodynamics, but the detailed frequency

181
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:12,100
dependence of the energies there is. Significant

182
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:16,060
divergent differences between the classical and

183
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:19,330
quantum theories in the appropriate low

184
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:23,530
temperature quantum regimes, and we will see if

185
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:26,050
anything, even more striking effects next week

186
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:30,700
when we return to fermions, which exhibit the less

187
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:34,310
familiar behavior that only a single forensic

188
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,080
particle can occupy any energy level.
