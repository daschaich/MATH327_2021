1
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:06,500
OK, the recording should now be running, we should

2
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:11,950
get underway on bright and Sunny. Afternoon here

3
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:18,520
in Liverpool with the usual setup and the start

4
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:22,120
off that may be familiar at this point of the term,

5
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:30,450
the. Screen shared unioned. Start off with the

6
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:38,540
usual pull, you see if there are. Any questions or

7
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:44,360
requests about things to focus on today and if

8
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:48,140
there are not, at least while folks may continue

9
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:48,560
to.

10
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:52,580
Enter and join the meeting over the next few

11
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:56,800
minutes. Can comment on. Some of the logistics

12
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:02,110
looking ahead towards the end of term, so the ramp

13
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:04,630
up for the continuous assessment, the second

14
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:09,490
homework assignment is due next Tuesday. And of

15
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:14,460
course, questions on that are. Welcome in the

16
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:18,120
synchronous sessions, there is a limit to how

17
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,680
directly and I can answer them. And after that, I

18
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,810
heard this morning that the. Semester two exam

19
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:30,160
timetable has finally now appeared with the

20
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:35,260
statistical physics exam scheduled for Tuesday,

21
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:41,950
the 25th of May. So a little over a month from now

22
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:45,310
and a little under a month after that last

23
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:46,490
homework is due.

24
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:54,980
And some sample exams and sample problems for

25
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,310
additional preparation are already on the canvass

26
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:04,670
sites and more will be added as the actual course

27
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:09,370
content for the for the module starts to wind down.

28
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,920
And checking it again to see that.

29
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:28,510
No questions have come in yet. I can. Hop over to.

30
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:33,690
Where we got to on one day and just pick up from

31
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:38,490
there, going through the materials, commenting on

32
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:44,190
both some of the actual stuff that's in here that

33
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,140
you can, of course, read for yourself, as well as

34
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:51,480
going beyond that to give some supplemental

35
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,810
background information for for those who may be

36
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:58,380
curious, it's trying to anticipate what might be

37
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:01,800
of interest and also maybe highlighting some of

38
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,100
the connections of this module to other aspects of

39
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:10,330
mathematics and physics. So. Where we wrapped up

40
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,220
last time was.

41
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:20,610
Elaborating on. How the photon energy is being

42
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,420
linearly proportional to their momentum rather

43
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,760
than proportional to the momentum squared like we

44
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,810
saw for non relativistic particles that can be

45
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:34,320
before, this is the opposite of a relativistic

46
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:38,660
limit. We went through the general relation

47
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,170
between mass energy and kinetic energy that

48
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:45,050
connects these two elements of non relativistic

49
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:50,530
appleford relativistic particles, but the. More

50
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:55,300
usual way of presenting the energy for ultra

51
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,930
relativistic particles like photons is to hop over

52
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:04,780
to looking at them as waves through a physics

53
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:07,360
concept known as wave particle duality that we

54
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,580
don't need to get into here. What this does is

55
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:16,990
connect the momentum of a photon or any other

56
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:24,310
relativistic particle to a wavelength or. The

57
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:27,340
inverse of that wavelength is known as the

58
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:30,550
frequency. The frequency is essentially

59
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:39,560
how many? Peaks and troughs of a wave past an

60
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,870
observer and a given amount of time, and that

61
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:44,150
depends on two things. First, how quickly the wave

62
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:47,000
is traveling, and secondly, how far apart those

63
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,050
peaks and troughs are spaced. That distance

64
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:53,480
between the peaks and troughs is precisely the

65
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:57,350
wave length and the speed of the wave. In the case

66
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:01,010
of photons is exactly that speed of light, see?

67
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:07,170
Which gives this generic relation for waves

68
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:10,770
between frequency and wavelength that.

69
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:17,540
The product of frequency times wavelength is equal

70
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:21,940
to the speed of propagation of the wave, which. We

71
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:26,410
can illustrate through. Some additional graphics

72
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:31,120
beyond what I included in the lecture notes here,

73
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,540
and we'll look at that just by observing that this

74
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:40,780
relation between the momentum of a photon and its

75
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:44,670
corresponding wavelength, once we have quanties,

76
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:49,870
these particles, by working in a finite volume. As

77
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:53,860
as we started doing way back in week four and in

78
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:57,820
reviewed over the past week, we end up with that

79
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:02,530
full time energy. Equals P, C just becomes an

80
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:06,310
expression again now proportional to the frequency

81
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:10,540
of the wave, the frequency of the photon at the

82
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:15,820
photon energy is far omega. And this is

83
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:21,190
illustrated in a bit more detail in this picture

84
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:26,230
here, which is showing a couple of aspects of

85
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:30,820
energies and wavelengths for waves of light.

86
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:33,430
Understood here we're getting a bit beyond the

87
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,250
core material for the module into a bit more of

88
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,620
the physics background that may be of interest,

89
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:43,360
where the folks on, when considered as a wave, is

90
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,380
specifically a wave in an electromagnetic field.

91
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,050
So this is the general electromagnetic spectrum.

92
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:58,130
The full range of possible wavelengths for.

93
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:07,140
For photons and as the wavelength gets longer over

94
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:13,120
on the left side. Of this picture here, which I.

95
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:18,200
Looks like I should be able to draw on. We'll see.

96
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:24,220
And will that works. Nothing showing up, so.

97
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:28,660
Looks like it will just be commentary and not

98
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:33,150
colouring in, but over on the left side. Off the

99
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:36,000
top of the stigma, we have the the long wavelength

100
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,230
regime looking at waves getting up to

101
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:46,980
a kilometer or more in size, similar to the size

102
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:52,020
of buildings and cities, which from the.

103
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:57,880
Connection between energy and frequency and the

104
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,430
connection then between frequency as the inverse

105
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:04,690
of wavelength we know corresponds to low energies

106
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:08,560
and low frequencies from long wavelengths.

107
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:14,920
And as we move up through many orders of magnitude

108
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:19,750
in wavelength and in photon frequency, we

109
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:24,730
eventually get into the microwave and then even

110
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:28,870
after that, the visible spectrum of a few hundred

111
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:32,950
nanometer wavelengths, both of which pop up at

112
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:38,110
different points in the materials for for this

113
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:41,770
week, microwaves in the guise of the cosmic

114
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:45,070
microwave background, invisible lights as the

115
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:49,240
wavelengths where the radiation from the sun

116
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:55,480
reaching the earth is is maximal and then going on

117
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,600
even further to shorter wavelengths at higher

118
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,450
frequencies that correspond to higher energies. We

119
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:06,100
get past the ultraviolet into X-ray and gamma ray

120
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:12,350
photons, which. As I should also point out, the

121
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,360
the very bottom aspect of this picture here that.

122
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,690
Those higher energy photons with higher

123
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:24,960
frequencies and shorter wavelengths are emitted by

124
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,800
objects with higher and higher temperatures. The

125
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,100
visible spectrum corresponding to temperatures

126
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:36,570
around a few thousand Kelvin like the surface

127
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:41,340
temperature of of our sun. And getting up into x

128
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,950
rays and gamma rays requires temperatures getting

129
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,530
up into the millions or tens of millions of Kelvin,

130
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:49,500
which is more like the interior temperature of

131
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:53,070
stars like the white dwarfs that will appear in

132
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:55,370
the materials next week.

133
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:05,230
So one other aspect of photons that. Is mentioned

134
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,450
here in maybe. Interesting to elaborate on is this

135
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:15,760
overall factor of two. Which not assuming any

136
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:21,340
physics background and for this material. You

137
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:25,240
mentioned just came from the fact that any given

138
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:29,950
energy level for a photon comes in, comes with a

139
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:35,020
partner or a pair. So for every single energy

140
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:39,910
related to a quantized frequency in this equation,

141
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,450
ninety nine, there are two degenerate energy

142
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:46,900
levels with precisely that energy and the.

143
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,220
Specific feature or quantum number that

144
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:56,700
distinguishes those two energy levels with the

145
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:00,870
same energy is something known as the polarization

146
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:04,920
of the photon, which again is easiest to.

147
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,220
Appreciate by picturing photogs as these

148
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,470
propagating waves in the electromagnetic field.

149
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:19,040
Where? The small little graphic here is showing

150
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:23,710
precisely that sort of. Propagating waves in an

151
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:28,740
electromagnetic field. The red portion of the wave

152
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,870
is the electric part, the blue portion is the

153
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,540
magnetic part, and they have to come at this 90

154
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:38,070
degree angle where we have a photon propagating

155
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:44,250
along the y axis in this diagram with. The

156
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:49,260
electric parts oscillating or waving linearly in

157
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:53,130
the Z direction and the magnetic part oscillating

158
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:56,640
in the direction. And this is one of the two

159
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:01,410
possible polarizations for this photon, this

160
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:04,410
electromagnetic wave with this particular

161
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:10,060
frequency. In the other colorization comes just

162
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:15,400
from rotating. This wave by 90 degrees about that

163
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:20,170
y it's propagating alone, and so in that case, the

164
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,800
the red portion corresponding to the electric

165
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,020
parts of the electromagnetic field would be

166
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:28,510
oscillating back and forth in the X direction

167
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:33,010
rather than the Z direction. And the blue magnetic

168
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:36,280
parts of the wave would be oscillating back and

169
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,130
forth in the Z direction.

170
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:44,740
So all photons, all the electromagnetic waves can

171
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:50,500
be split up into those two separate polarizations,

172
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:55,210
each of which forms a distinct energy level with

173
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,110
the identical energy. And what are the other five

174
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:04,280
of those is what gets filtered out by polarized

175
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:08,240
sunglasses to give an everyday connection of this

176
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:14,420
image, of this concept. So if you were to take two

177
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:18,650
pairs of polarized sunglasses and hold them up at

178
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:24,470
90 degrees to each other, the first pair of those

179
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,600
sunglasses would filter out one of these

180
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:30,590
polarizations of the photons coming in. The second

181
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:33,980
pair oriented 90 degrees to it would filter out

182
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,710
the other pair and exactly no lights would get

183
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:41,330
through, which is a nice experiment you can do.

184
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,310
Well, maybe not at home, but maybe in a sunglass

185
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:47,010
shop, if you will, depending on how many pairs of

186
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:49,320
sunglasses you have just to.

187
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,700
Confirm that the sunglasses are, in fact,

188
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,690
polarized and see how the polarization of light,

189
00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:01,300
these two degenerate energy levels for every four

190
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:04,710
started to degenerate energy levels for every

191
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:08,340
frequency of photon that defines this energy show

192
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,850
up. In.

193
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:19,060
In our everyday world, so. The big simplification

194
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:22,860
and the reason that. We focus only on four times

195
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,880
in this week's material is that. Photons,

196
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,880
especially in a large volume, are extremely easy

197
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,310
to create and destroy. There's an enormous flood

198
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:35,850
of photons coming in right now off of your screen,

199
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:39,660
out of any lights that you might have on or coming

200
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:44,280
in through any windows that are also being

201
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:48,600
absorbed by all of the materials giving those

202
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,810
materials their distinctive color. And what this

203
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:54,630
amounts to is that the amount of energy being

204
00:14:54,780 --> 00:15:00,240
introduced or removed from the gas of photons that

205
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,770
were swimming in is. Extremely small for any one

206
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:10,800
of those given photons. And hence the

207
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:15,030
corresponding chemical potential defined as the

208
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,350
change in energy. Resulting from adding or

209
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:23,420
removing one photon at a fixed entropy, so any

210
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:26,070
radically changing the number of photons in the

211
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:33,210
gas is essentially zero for the photon gas so that

212
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:33,570
the.

213
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:38,120
Grand canonical partition function and its

214
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,130
corresponding logarithm, the grand canonical

215
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:44,120
potential just ends up with no further dependence

216
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,880
on the chemical potential, depending only on the

217
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,880
photon energy, and through that, the photon

218
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:56,210
frequency. Omega, in all, we could go through

219
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:59,900
these same sorts of calculation steps for.

220
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:07,610
More generic ozone's with a non zero chemical

221
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:10,010
potential, in particular, a negative chemical

222
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:14,210
potential in order for the number of density of

223
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:19,500
the ozone gas to remain finite, that adds a. A

224
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:24,350
significant amount of complication and. Additional

225
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:29,600
complexity, and so it's something that. I won't

226
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,770
even get into in the synchronous session except

227
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:35,480
for maybe some generic remarks, if there's

228
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:40,250
interest, you can just refer you to some of the

229
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:44,990
additional references at the very start of the

230
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:47,090
lecture notes, in particular, David Tong's

231
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:51,320
statistical physics lectures and also the text

232
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:55,580
book by Dan Schroeder. Both go into these

233
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:56,990
calculations for.

234
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:03,180
Massive Lozano's with a non-zero chemical

235
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:07,020
potential where we need to introduce concepts of

236
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:10,740
the density of states and actually end up being

237
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:15,240
able to observe a phase transition in a non

238
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:20,220
interacting ideal system, which is quite unusual,

239
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:22,530
that phase transition is going between two

240
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:25,380
different phases of matter. The the gases that

241
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:29,160
we're looking at here for photons is one of those

242
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,890
phases. And the other phase is what's called a

243
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:36,540
Bose Einstein condensate that exists at low

244
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:42,120
temperatures was predicted theoretically by both

245
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:45,870
an Einstein, a good 70 years before technology was

246
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:49,800
sufficiently advanced to create it in the 1990s,

247
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:54,870
which was very promptly awarded the 2001 Nobel

248
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:56,490
Prize in physics. So

249
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:04,050
that's an aside that I will leave for later and

250
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:06,420
first go through the simpler case of the photon

251
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:11,790
gas with varnishing chemical potential. Looking

252
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:12,810
first at.

253
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,400
Some of the.

254
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,480
Recasting of the great economic potential that

255
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:27,240
we're able to do precisely because large volumes

256
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:30,330
are easy to come by compared to the wavelengths of

257
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:35,040
photons, often on those micrometer or even

258
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,210
nanometre scales.

259
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:42,320
So going through the same sort of trick that we

260
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,650
didn't work for in the case of a classical, non

261
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:50,090
relativistic ideal, gas you replace the sun is

262
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:57,090
over discrete momenta with a. Integration over the

263
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,310
corresponding real variables that I decorate with

264
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:06,160
the hat here. This turns out to be. As we will see,

265
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,540
an excellent approximation, and because the photon

266
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:15,700
energy only depends on the magnitude. Of this

267
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:21,830
momentum index by Kohat. We can carry out the

268
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:25,970
angular portions of these intervals, getting the

269
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:32,930
positive octet of the three sphere, I think I

270
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:36,620
merged together two words, both the three and the

271
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:41,870
sphere, that phrase. So keeping all of the

272
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:47,760
frequencies positive, we just pick out the. One

273
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,670
eighth of the total angle of the sphere that we're

274
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:54,420
integrating over a corresponding to positive

275
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:57,870
frequencies in the X, Y and Z direction, so the

276
00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:01,590
total solid angle is surface area of a sphere for

277
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:06,620
pi divided by eight. And that gives us just as

278
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:12,860
integral over. Momenta, which we can then. Relate

279
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:18,090
back to the photon frequency. To turn into an

280
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:21,420
integration over the frequencies of these photons.

281
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:26,670
Recognizing from the factors of all that come in

282
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:30,570
through that changing variables, the overall

283
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:34,550
volume. Of the photographs, as well as its

284
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:38,870
temperature hanging out outside of this integral

285
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:40,760
over Frequency's Omega.

286
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:58,060
Quickly check the. People everywhere think that's

287
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:03,370
just going to hang out for the. Of course, of

288
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:07,690
today, and just checking to see that there are no

289
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:10,870
questions yet there, and those of you who are on

290
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:14,830
synchronously are, of course, free to hop in with

291
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:19,580
questions out loud or through the chat window. And

292
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:24,400
I won't bother to wait long for those I'll keep

293
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,980
charging ahead. With the commentary that part of

294
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:33,330
the reason for casting the Grand Canal as a

295
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:36,750
potential in the form of this integral over

296
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:42,960
frequencies has to do with connections to. Physics

297
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,450
experiments, or maybe better to say, physics,

298
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:50,040
observations of sources of photons, both light and

299
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:53,260
heat and ultraviolet radiation like radiation,

300
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:57,420
like gamma rays, where the typical measurements

301
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:00,090
being done in these.

302
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:07,160
Observations and experiments consists in measuring

303
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:12,470
how much energy is being carried by photons of a

304
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:17,030
particular frequency. So by pulling out this

305
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:21,680
integration over the frequency, the integrated. Of

306
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:25,490
the frequency is precisely the information being

307
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:30,320
measured in those experiments, and I do see that a

308
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:36,440
question came in to do the boxes on. Page 110 and

309
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:44,130
111, which. You have to do with carrying out the.

310
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:49,310
The actual integrals here. So we will get to that,

311
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:52,370
I think, before the end of today and before

312
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:57,400
carrying out the integrals, I'm going to. Just say

313
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:02,080
a few things about the integration itself, what

314
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:08,790
shows up in the. Integration of frequency and it

315
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:15,200
is, in fact, useful to hop ahead to that page. 110.

316
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:22,900
Where? In this box, we actually see the.

317
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,050
Integrated itself.

318
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:32,230
As computed earlier on, so playing out this

319
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:35,500
dependence on the frequency or magnitude in the

320
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:38,110
numerator with an exponential factor in the

321
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:39,940
denominator, and

322
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:44,800
in fact, I think the discussion works just as well.

323
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,860
Whichever order we do it in, whether we integrate

324
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,120
first and then look at the

325
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:57,070
look at the integration or going over or focus on

326
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:59,250
the integration and then complete the integration.

327
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:03,910
So let's carry out these integrals and then circle

328
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:06,580
back around in the lecture notes to comment on

329
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:12,250
some of the physics connections where what we need

330
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,380
to do.

331
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:23,460
For. This is a girl here on page 110 is getting

332
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:26,460
into the form of the integration that we're given

333
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:29,820
just above it, this fun combination of the game of

334
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:34,350
function and the remote Zeta function. And we see

335
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:39,750
that this integral here involves a factor of each

336
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:44,050
of the power X or as our starting point involves

337
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:47,730
the exponential factor of Beita times each our

338
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:49,920
times, amigo, which is the energy divided by

339
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,770
temperature calling the beta is the inverse

340
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:58,230
temperature. So our X to get these two integrals

341
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:03,060
into the same form. Needs to be precisely that

342
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:08,220
beater, each bar Omega, which is the energy of the

343
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:12,090
photon or a mega divided by temperature, and then

344
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:15,210
that substitution gives ADX.

345
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:21,630
Rather should. Express it as the almighty negative

346
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:29,370
is equal to. Temperature over age four times to X,

347
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:36,880
so from the. Three powers of Omega in the

348
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,450
numerator and the Omega that is also hanging out

349
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:44,200
there and see, we're going to pick up four powers

350
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:49,950
of this factor. T over h bar so that.

351
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:55,860
Comes along with that constant factor to your

352
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:58,040
average bar to the fourth.

353
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:08,080
And. When Omega zero zero and Sable's infinity, we

354
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:12,960
have precisely executed over E to the X minus one

355
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:17,770
to X, which is part of the four over 15. So

356
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:21,640
putting things together, there is a team of the

357
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:27,300
fourth on top. For factors of high cancel out two

358
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:31,050
of those in the denominator, so PI squared is left

359
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:36,240
in the numerator of 15 in the denominator and.

360
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:41,910
That factor of bar divided by each part of the

361
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:44,640
force leaves each bar cubed in the denominator and

362
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:49,920
cubed in that is. As promised, proportional to

363
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:54,690
this power of tea and to the fourth.

364
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:58,560
And.

365
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:07,080
Given that result, it may well be a. Fun exercise

366
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:12,760
to compute the heat capacity. For this, folks, I

367
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:16,030
guess maybe I won't.

368
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:29,150
I won't stop for too long asking that question and

369
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:33,970
calling that the heat capacity is related to this

370
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:36,670
energy density, but I'll leave that just up in the

371
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:39,580
background on people everywhere. It's something to

372
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:43,330
think about while we look at the similar

373
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:47,230
calculation for the number of density.

374
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:52,920
We're now we have. A similar looking integral over

375
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:57,810
these frequencies that corresponds to a slightly

376
00:27:57,810 --> 00:28:02,160
different combination of. The other functions in

377
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:06,340
remote Zeta functions and maybe before writing

378
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:09,080
down this integral, I should.

379
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:15,170
Swap back and forth and highlight the similarity

380
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:19,550
between the energy density and the number of

381
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:23,840
density where we can see if we look closely and

382
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,830
maybe doing that asynchronously in offline would

383
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:31,280
be the better way to go than trying to fit them

384
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:36,040
both onto the same screen here. But the integrals

385
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:41,210
here only differ by the energy density inserting.

386
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:50,740
A factor of the energy, each bar Omega. Into the

387
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:54,680
integrated here, so instead of just counting the

388
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:59,840
number of photons. You're picking up or

389
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,630
integrating over the energy that is carried by

390
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:05,270
each of those photons. So instead of a. make a

391
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:09,050
square deal bigger, the integral for the energy is

392
00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:12,770
each four times will make a huge mega.

393
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:18,970
So we use that trick again with FERME on Gas's

394
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:22,450
next week, and so it's worth commenting on here,

395
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:30,600
but doing that same substitution. Of ex. Age for

396
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:36,500
Omega, you can charge ahead in see that we now

397
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:42,410
have only three powers of that T over H Bar two

398
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:45,050
from the Omega squared the numerator and a third

399
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:50,640
from Jamaica and then the integral. From zero to

400
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:55,260
infinity of X squared over to the X minus one, the

401
00:29:55,290 --> 00:30:04,290
X, which was our two times Z A three. So plugging

402
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:06,300
things in is.

403
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:09,590
We pull it

404
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:17,480
to zero three T cubed out front.

405
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:24,710
And everything in the denominator is left over.

406
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,360
Each bar cube cubed in PI squared.

407
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:42,020
So with that computed, they see that. You know,

408
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:45,040
there is agreements about the.

409
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:52,760
Heat capacity for the photon gas. I'll switch

410
00:30:52,760 --> 00:31:00,590
things back to the question about where we've been.

411
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:06,240
Opportunity for questions to come in for many of

412
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,530
you and just.

413
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:17,710
Comment that the heat capacity itself.

414
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:25,520
That constant pressure is that. Derivative in the

415
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:29,060
energy with respect to the temperature at constant

416
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:32,330
bullying, with aggressive pressure just now. So

417
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:39,680
taking the. Temperature derivative of. This t to

418
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:43,760
the power for just leaves us with our three and

419
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:45,770
all the rest of the cast of factors that come

420
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:47,870
along for the ride and.

421
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:54,460
Yeah. Come in and assume about the gap on page one

422
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:57,820
of the six is I think our next pretty much our

423
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:59,260
next stop, because we saw

424
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:04,900
Biden jumping ahead to that integration. We looked

425
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:07,990
at a bit of detail at this integration here that

426
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:11,620
appears in the expression for the total energy

427
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:15,550
density. And I mentioned earlier before that

428
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:22,780
digression that it is this. Spectral density, the

429
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:25,480
thing that is being integrated over that is

430
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:29,260
actually measured in experimental observations.

431
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:35,530
With this plot here not actually being those

432
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:37,420
experimental measurements, but being an

433
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:41,830
illustration mathematically of how this idealized

434
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:46,510
Planck spectrum for non interacting photons

435
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:50,860
behaves as a function of the temperature, which is

436
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:56,490
the inverse of data or beta is the inverse

437
00:32:56,530 --> 00:33:00,700
temperature, whereas the temperature gets higher

438
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:05,650
the peak. You see, if I can get both the equation

439
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,960
and the plot on the screen here

440
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:15,580
in the limit of large wavelengths and the limit of

441
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:19,660
small wavelengths, the spectrum goes to zero. And

442
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:24,400
because. Spectrum here is plotted as a function of

443
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,460
wavelength rather than the function of frequency

444
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:31,780
that we derive starting from the grand canonical

445
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:34,120
proficient function. It's worth.

446
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:41,400
Going through the requested box here on page 106

447
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:46,700
to change variables. And get to get the energy

448
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:51,710
density expressed as an integral over the

449
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:58,380
wavelength rather than the frequency. So the. The

450
00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:02,110
straightforward part of this is just substituting

451
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:10,090
in three powers of that wavelength in three powers

452
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:14,420
of the frequency turn into three powers. Of

453
00:34:14,430 --> 00:34:21,000
wavelength, so omega, is that too pricey, divided

454
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:29,110
by the waves like lambda? And. Looking at the. A

455
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:32,720
derivative of Omega with respect to LAMDA, then we

456
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:36,830
pull out that power just before things here for.

457
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:42,230
Use it for being explicit, the derivative of one

458
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:46,970
over lambda is minus one over lambda squared by C

459
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:50,780
come along for the ride in a D lambda.

460
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:58,200
Is. Up in the numerator in the.

461
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,630
One of the ways that's a minus sign could go

462
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:11,820
astray in this calculation is when converting this

463
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:17,560
integral from. Frequency to wavelength, we also

464
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:21,850
have to convert the limits, so as W goes to zero

465
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:25,240
and the lower limits of the center grow, that

466
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:30,280
corresponds to Lambda going to infinity and

467
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:36,100
similarly, W to infinity is the high energy limit

468
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:42,010
of very low wavelengths. And then we have the

469
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:46,060
lambda up fronts, but rather. That's minus.

470
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:56,470
To or the minus comes from only the deal a factor.

471
00:35:56,490 --> 00:36:01,890
This is just positive see Cube with a minus two

472
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:07,900
plus C from the Omega. And then PI squared C cubed

473
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,910
lambda cubes from the Omega Cube, Lambda squared

474
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:16,210
from the Omega and then E to the.

475
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:25,280
Two pi beat each bar, C over lambda, minus one.

476
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:28,900
The Alanda.

477
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:36,500
So that is all of the factors that we then. You

478
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,540
have to deal with.

479
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:47,150
And pulling things out front, I see four factors

480
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:49,310
of two, which is 16.

481
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:57,960
There are four factors of pi in the denominator

482
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:01,560
there and there, and also four factors in the

483
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,270
numerator that will cancel out.

484
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:07,200
We have.

485
00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:18,800
An issue because I duplicated things and going in

486
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,490
the wrong here, I wrote those PI squared CS in two

487
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:26,930
different places, so. Let's go back to the blue

488
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:33,020
and fix the pies, the annoying feature of that, a

489
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:36,610
racer racing. Everything that comes around.

490
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:42,270
I put it in both places, so.

491
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:46,610
Just rewrite this.

492
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:51,450
Without commentary this time.

493
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:59,180
And it looks a bit simpler than the cumulonimbus

494
00:37:59,180 --> 00:37:59,720
squared

495
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:07,650
E two by being the first C over lambda. Minus one

496
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:12,390
day lamda, so 16 and there are two powers of pi

497
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:17,820
leftover. There is one factor of C that goes along

498
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:22,440
with that factor of bar. And then everything else

499
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:29,790
is this function of lamda where I can absorb that

500
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:34,790
minus sine. By reversing the order of integration

501
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:38,210
rather than from infinity to zero, make it zero to

502
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:42,420
infinity. He has written.

503
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:46,290
The.

504
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:52,490
It should have been written earlier in the notes.

505
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:58,150
Then there is a dilemma for Lambda five and this

506
00:38:58,150 --> 00:39:02,810
exponential factor. Each person related to minus

507
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:08,440
one and we can check the. Overall, negative signs

508
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:15,430
by noting that this quantity here. Is just the

509
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:18,520
Planck spectrum as a function of wavelength, what

510
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:22,690
is plotted up here, and this is obviously a

511
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:29,280
positive. So we have the correct overall sign that

512
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,430
is also written there.

513
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,720
Judging now.

514
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,570
In the time that we have left, what would be worth

515
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:02,480
going through, I think I'll. Talk about the cosmic

516
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,460
microwave background. Bits and.

517
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:15,920
Wrap up the equation of state on Monday where the.

518
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:19,960
Having gone through the change of variables.

519
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:27,430
To get things in terms of the wavelength lamda, we

520
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:28,780
can now see that.

521
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:37,210
Suspects that were plotting here has that formed.

522
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:45,270
One over. Lambed is the fifth time's not enough

523
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:50,550
space here, so zoom in and narrate this a bit

524
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:54,060
smaller if it recognizes the eraser.

525
00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:09,170
One over land is the fifth and then an exponential

526
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:14,730
factor. That goes like each of the one over minus

527
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:15,120
one.

528
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:23,730
Where I'm omitting all of the factors of the

529
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:26,770
factor of beta in there, but ignore HRC in those

530
00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:29,050
other Karlsson's of it in the high temperature

531
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:33,480
limit relevant for. Classical physics, this e to

532
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:38,250
the Beethoven land of minus one, we can expand in

533
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:43,290
terms of the small beta as one plus beta over

534
00:41:43,290 --> 00:41:46,830
lambda, but once cancel and that one over lambda

535
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:51,570
cancels out the. What are those five factors of

536
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:56,960
Canada so classically? The spectrum that would be

537
00:41:57,170 --> 00:41:58,220
predicted for.

538
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:08,120
For later, for electromagnetic radiation is one

539
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:10,740
over lambdas of the power for which is what's

540
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:16,070
shown in. This black line here diverging as a

541
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:19,150
Kordic function as the way of life gets smaller,

542
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:23,180
but thanks to quantum effects that bring in this

543
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:27,020
factor of the exponential, as Lambda gets smaller

544
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:31,040
for any non-zero or any non-zero obeida, any

545
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:34,460
finite temperature, this exponential factor

546
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,170
becomes exponentially large, exponentially quickly

547
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,080
and.

548
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:44,940
As it shows up in the denominator, it suppresses

549
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:47,700
the overall spectrum and sends it crashing back

550
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:53,250
down to zero after some peak. That depends on the

551
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:58,350
particular temperature. And this is exactly what

552
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,920
the physicists of one hundred years ago.

553
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:08,050
Wanted to see since the measurements that they had

554
00:43:08,050 --> 00:43:11,920
been able to do of things like the sun and ovens

555
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:16,690
at that at that time and showing precisely that

556
00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:22,120
decrease at small wavelengths in the ultraviolet

557
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:27,340
regime of high energies and the fact that the

558
00:43:27,370 --> 00:43:31,540
classical calculation are named after a rally in

559
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:37,990
genes to. Two English physicists of the early

560
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:41,080
nineteen hundreds, one of whom was was from

561
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:45,790
Ormskirk team Sheens, was a native of Lancashire.

562
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:47,170
They found that.

563
00:43:49,810 --> 00:43:52,720
Courting divergence in the classical prediction

564
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:57,200
rather than. The reduction in the ultraviolet,

565
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,350
which became known as the ultraviolet catastrophe

566
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:07,260
that Max Planck was able to. Cure simply by

567
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:10,380
hypothesizing the form of the spectrum that now

568
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:14,280
bears his name, which we were able to. Derive

569
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:17,390
ourselves from the quantum theory that came along

570
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:18,900
a couple of decades later.

571
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:23,740
And, you know.

572
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:32,910
With a couple of minutes left, maybe the quickest

573
00:44:32,910 --> 00:44:35,730
thing to fit in to that last bit of time is to hop

574
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:42,500
back to. Some of these boxes on. Pages one, 10 and

575
00:44:42,650 --> 00:44:43,160
11.

576
00:44:45,230 --> 00:44:47,360
And note that.

577
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:52,960
With these calculations, we're able to get a nice

578
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:56,800
correlation between the average energy and the

579
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,780
average number of particles where for a non

580
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:03,340
relativistic case, we had one of our key equations

581
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:05,470
for the classical ideal gas. And the canonical

582
00:45:05,470 --> 00:45:08,290
example was that the energy was.

583
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:18,280
Three halves times, indeed, for some reason, the

584
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:23,180
screen is. But half blank, we get something

585
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:26,930
similar in this case only with the factor of

586
00:45:26,930 --> 00:45:30,890
roughly two point seven rather than a factor of

587
00:45:30,890 --> 00:45:34,550
three, has that two point seven comes from both

588
00:45:35,510 --> 00:45:38,630
the effect of photons being relativistic particles

589
00:45:39,710 --> 00:45:45,210
as well as the. The role of quantum physics coming

590
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:48,840
into this realisation of their wavelengths and

591
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:51,810
actually the sample exam that's posted on the

592
00:45:51,810 --> 00:45:58,230
canvas sites. Asks about these non relativistic

593
00:45:58,230 --> 00:46:01,830
particles or sadistic, so the ultra relativistic

594
00:46:01,830 --> 00:46:07,320
energy in the canonical ensemble where we get even

595
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:12,750
a. Third, relation between energy and no density.

596
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:17,570
That is exactly three times the number of

597
00:46:17,570 --> 00:46:22,420
particles, types of temperature. So. The two

598
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:26,750
effects are. We can disentangle from these three

599
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:30,980
pieces of influence that go on from a classical,

600
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:33,620
non relativistic ideal gas to a classical

601
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:38,210
relativistic ideal, gas doubles the energy density

602
00:46:39,050 --> 00:46:43,880
from three 1/2 to three and then introducing the

603
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:46,400
quantum effects that cure that ultraviolet

604
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:52,930
catastrophe. Bring the relation back down again by

605
00:46:53,530 --> 00:46:59,070
almost exactly 10 percent. This is. Quite a

606
00:46:59,070 --> 00:47:03,110
precise and in fact, an exact. Ratio of Gamma

607
00:47:03,110 --> 00:47:06,800
function to Zeta functions in this approximation

608
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:10,100
of photon gas being completely not interacting.

609
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:14,880
Which turns out to be a good description of.

610
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:21,800
Both the sun and the cosmic microwave background

611
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:25,220
that they talk about on next Monday,

612
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:30,500
and particularly in the case of the cosmic

613
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:32,330
microwave background, this really fantastic

614
00:47:32,330 --> 00:47:37,070
agreement between the not interacting, idealized

615
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:39,950
theoretical prediction and the observed

616
00:47:39,950 --> 00:47:42,680
measurements which provide some of the strongest

617
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:47,510
evidence for dark matter. So with that, hints

618
00:47:47,510 --> 00:47:51,470
about some of the connections of this module to

619
00:47:51,470 --> 00:47:55,190
broader physics. I'll stop there, check one last

620
00:47:55,190 --> 00:48:01,230
time for any final questions and. If there aren't

621
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:04,390
any. See you all again next week.
