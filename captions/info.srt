00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:05,580
Hello and welcome to statistical physics math

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,660
three to seven in the spring term of twenty twenty

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,620
one, I am David Schaich, the coordinator for this

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:17,910
module, and I will be coming at you through these

5
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:22,590
asynchronous recorded videos for the remainder of

6
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:27,060
the academic year, as well as through synchronous

7
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:31,830
sessions and indirectly through the lecture notes

8
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:35,820
being written up for this module as we go along.

9
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:41,340
So let me in this introductory and logistical

10
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:46,350
overview video, just provide some commentary about

11
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:48,630
how this module is going to be delivered, what the

12
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:51,840
plans are, and what the scope is to change those

13
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,040
plans. If we all decide that they aren't working

14
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,500
as well as they should be, and it might be worth

15
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:03,290
experimenting with something different. The module

16
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:07,110
is following the notes driven delivery model that

17
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:12,210
was developed by by the department over the over

18
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,970
the summer and the previous terms of trying to

19
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:19,140
incorporate lessons learned from the autumn term

20
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,060
during which I was not delivering any course, any

21
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,720
modules. So this is going to be new territory for

22
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:34,860
me even compared to to your experience. And in

23
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:40,410
that notes driven delivery framework, the bulk of

24
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:44,460
the asynchronous content is coming to you through

25
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:48,240
typeset notes that I am producing as we go along

26
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,840
in the term and there will just be order. Twenty

27
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,650
minutes of video recordings like this every week,

28
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,800
primarily as far as I'm concerned, to give more of

29
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,550
a human element to the course, especially while we

30
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:06,120
are not able to meet in person, and especially for

31
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,810
those of you who are not going to be able to join

32
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:13,260
the synchronous sessions. Speaking of the

33
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:16,170
synchronous sessions, they are currently and

34
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:19,950
hopefully finally scheduled for Monday mornings at

35
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:24,120
nine a.m. and Thursday afternoons at 1:00 p.m. and

36
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,600
I'll have some remote office hours in the hour

37
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,570
immediately following those synchronous sessions

38
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:33,570
on both of those two days, as well as by

39
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,540
appointment that you can schedule online if those

40
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,890
times don't work for you.

41
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,840
Now, if you're watching this, you've presumably

42
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,150
found it through the canvass site for the course

43
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,920
because that's for the module, since that's the

44
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,460
only place where I expect to upload it. You can

45
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:55,020
also find there the lecture notes. And I'll just

46
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,680
say a bit about those lecture notes which you can

47
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,520
have in front of you or have already read as you

48
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,820
listen to these recordings, if indeed anyone is

49
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:10,000
listening to this. The idea that I have with a

50
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:13,200
roughly 20 minutes of speaking a week is that I

51
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,680
won't go through those lecture notes in detail.

52
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:19,530
You can read just as well as you can. Listen, I

53
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:23,910
will instead provide a sort of introductory video

54
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:30,570
that reviews the big picture, context, motivation

55
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:34,050
and organizational logic of the topics being

56
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:36,840
covered each week. Then that should be about ten

57
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,970
minutes long as a reasonably bite sized overview.

58
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:45,120
And then I will provide a similar roughly ten

59
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,790
minute video covering the big takeaway messages

60
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:55,590
that hopefully were made clear. As you work

61
00:03:55,590 --> 00:04:00,030
through those lecture notes and I say work through

62
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,830
the lecture notes. And I sort of mean that

63
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:06,210
literally because these lecture notes have gaps in

64
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:09,390
them where you were asked some questions or asked

65
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:11,820
to perform some task in order to complete the

66
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:16,920
notes. And the action of carrying out that

67
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,680
exercise or answering that question is going to be

68
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:24,990
the main way that you really learn the material

69
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:30,000
and are able to apply it to resolve the or

70
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:32,160
complete the homework problems, homework

71
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,740
assignments and the final assessment that we

72
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,270
discuss in just a few minutes.

73
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:42,060
And this insight is not just my opinion, it's

74
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:48,210
coming from the literature on how learning happens

75
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:50,520
from this book, Make It Stick The Science of

76
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,140
Successful Learning, which is listed among the the

77
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:58,080
reading list for the module and the additional

78
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,440
resources in the lecture notes. Something that

79
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,320
might be interesting to check out, the take away

80
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:09,230
message from that is that the the more active the

81
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:12,320
you're learning is, the more you actually have to

82
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,220
do stuff in practice. The the skills and

83
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:19,100
information that you're trying to learn, the

84
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:22,130
faster you will learn it and the longer it will

85
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:26,990
stick. And the counterexample, which makes the

86
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:30,230
learning very slow and very transient, very easily

87
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:35,090
lost, is the more passive, non-active approach of

88
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:38,960
listening to recordings like this or reading

89
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:45,110
through those lecture notes. Now, incorporating

90
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:47,600
these gaps mean that existing lecture notes have

91
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,360
to be refactoring pretty substantially. So I'm

92
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,000
going through that as we proceed through the

93
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,730
course week by week, which also provides some

94
00:05:55,730 --> 00:06:01,310
flexibility to adapt to how the the current

95
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:04,700
approach is working and how you all are are

96
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:07,790
finding it and enjoying it. So do feel free to

97
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:10,640
give me feedback or suggestions about

98
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:15,560
what changes or what different ways of doing

99
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:19,010
things you would like to experiment with. And

100
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:22,370
depending on the time available, we will do all

101
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:29,030
the experimentation that that we can. This is a

102
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:31,310
relatively small module and also a relatively new

103
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:34,160
module. So there is a great deal of scope for

104
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:37,460
experimentation with its delivery, especially in

105
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:42,050
these exceptional circumstances. This is only the

106
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:44,570
second time the module has been offered in its

107
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:48,620
current form, and it's also the first time that I

108
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:52,610
am delivering it myself in its entirety. I

109
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:57,140
assisted as delivery last year coming in just as

110
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:01,070
the university campus shut down and the existing

111
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:03,380
lecture notes that we had then designed to be

112
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,670
followed along with during a live in-person

113
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:12,620
lecture, were all converted to slides for online

114
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:15,500
synchronous lectures of the sort that the

115
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,050
department decided we should absolutely not do

116
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:21,380
this year. So second time through the course, the

117
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:25,100
third delivery style, this hybrid mixture of

118
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,770
asynchronous material, mostly lecture notes

119
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:31,430
supplemented by these video recordings, plus the

120
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:34,070
synchronous sessions that I will also try to make

121
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:38,630
as active as possible. And the way I have in mind

122
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:42,980
to to do that, at least as a starting point to a

123
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:47,540
first approximation, is to focus on the gaps and

124
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:50,510
the gaps in the lecture notes that I just asked

125
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:53,780
you to to make sure you can fill. We'll look at

126
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:57,500
those, make sure everyone was able to fill them

127
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,860
successfully, answer any questions that came up

128
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:04,610
out of them. And if all that proves to be much too

129
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:06,920
easy, well, that gives me feedback to make the

130
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:11,690
gaps less trivial in the coming weeks as well as

131
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:13,880
while we are there in the synchronous sessions, we

132
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:19,430
can generalize the material go beyond what was

133
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:22,700
encapsulated in the lecture notes and highlighted

134
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:26,000
in the video recordings, and look at some of the

135
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:29,480
further applications of statistical physics.

136
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:35,330
Before we wrap up talk about the expected

137
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:37,220
background and assessment, I just want to say

138
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:42,440
briefly that in the expected course, the expected

139
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:46,490
schedule for the module that is on the first page

140
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:50,570
of the lecture notes, you can see a few weeks

141
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:54,650
focusing on topics in quantum physics. So I want

142
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:57,860
to emphasize that you do not need any background

143
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:02,750
in quantum physics to successfully complete this

144
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,660
module. Everything you need from there will be

145
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:06,320
provided.

146
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:13,770
And I will also just wrap up by looking at the

147
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:19,380
assessment we are, you know, in order to make sure

148
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,990
that the both the load of the content you're

149
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:23,880
expecting to learn as well as the assessment

150
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,560
you're expected to complete, are all reasonable.

151
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,730
We're keeping all of that the same as last year,

152
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,540
just reorganizing everything for this hybrid

153
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,810
remote delivery. We are also changing the weights

154
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:39,300
of the assessment so that more of the weight is

155
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,970
distributed evenly throughout the term

156
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:47,550
with deadlines that are centrally scheduled within

157
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:50,400
the department in an attempt to assure that

158
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,340
there's as little pile up as possible with lots of

159
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:57,720
things all due at the same time with the variety

160
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,570
of modular combinations. That's possible in years

161
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:04,830
three and four. This won't be a perfect system,

162
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:08,970
but it's better than just letting us, US module

163
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:12,560
coordinators be free to do whatever appeals to us.

164
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:16,890
So the assignment deadlines we we were assigned

165
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:20,820
for this module are Tuesdays in weeks, four, six,

166
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:26,820
seven and nine. And two of those assignments are

167
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,490
simple sort of traditional homework assignments

168
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:31,490
that will be released at least a week in advance.

169
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,920
The other two are a two part computer based

170
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:39,510
project where you will do a little bit of

171
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:44,370
programming to solve some statistical physics

172
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:49,110
problem that really cannot be very easily handled

173
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:54,420
with pen and paper techniques. So you're going to

174
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:58,350
have plenty of time to complete that project. And

175
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:01,350
it split into two parts to make sure that feedback

176
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:04,620
from the first part can be returned to you and

177
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:07,740
used to guide the second part, which may be useful

178
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,980
for those of you without any background in

179
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:14,070
programming. Background programming also not

180
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:17,310
assumed all the necessary information will be

181
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:20,670
provided and you will be free to complete the

182
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:24,660
project using whichever programming approach you

183
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:28,770
prefer or that. So I'm going to be focusing on

184
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:31,800
Python, which is a very widespread very.

185
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:38,920
Easily accessible free programming language that

186
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:43,660
is designed to be simple, to start using, starting

187
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:47,320
from no background in programming at all. I'll be

188
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:50,920
going through some demos showing all the necessary

189
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,940
programming techniques for the project in Python.

190
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:58,000
You're also free to use any other approach that

191
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,350
appeals to you that C are even matlab using the

192
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,140
the university site license.

193
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:11,080
I would advise against PayPal even if you're used

194
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,610
to it, because it may not be sufficient for the

195
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:19,420
the project that that will be completed, but that

196
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:22,090
is all something that we can explore in the coming

197
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:25,840
weeks. So with that, I've gone on more than long

198
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:31,990
enough on logistical issues. So if anything was

199
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:34,960
not covered that you want to know about or if you

200
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,420
have any questions that was that were brought up

201
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:43,420
by the past 10 or 12 minutes, feel free to toss

202
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:47,680
those into the campus discussion. Contact me

203
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,970
directly by email

204
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:57,460
or even raise an issue in the repository that is

205
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:00,700
being used to to develop and release the lecture

206
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,440
notes, which I really should have mentioned before

207
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:06,880
now. That gives you an opportunity to do a bit of

208
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,750
co creation, point out any issues with the lecture

209
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,270
notes as opposed to issues with the mathematics to

210
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:16,300
be discussed in the synchronous sessions or the

211
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:20,980
canvass discussion board and also even make

212
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:24,370
corrections yourself if you are so inclined,

213
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:31,330
entirely optional. But another way for you to have

214
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:35,740
contact with me and with all of the all of your

215
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:39,670
fellow students taking this module, which I hope

216
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:43,120
will be both interesting and as enjoyable as

217
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,600
possible in the current circumstances.
