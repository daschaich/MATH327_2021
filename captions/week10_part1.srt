00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,400
Hello and welcome back to Statistical Physics.

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:10,410
This is the first video for week 10 in the module,

3
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:14,010
providing a brief summary of the context,

4
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,710
motivations and key learning outcomes for this

5
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,980
week's material on interacting systems, which I

6
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:25,080
will bring up onto the screen, starting with just

7
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,720
a brief orientation, because getting to the point

8
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,940
that there's not too much left to to go through in

9
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:38,730
this module, interacting systems is the last. Big

10
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:45,600
topic building on the concepts, tools and

11
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,120
understanding that we have developed for

12
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:52,020
statistical systems over the previous nine weeks

13
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,020
of the course, looking at simplified systems that

14
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,290
consist of constituent particles that do not

15
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:02,760
interact with each other. So I've already said a

16
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,910
few times, but it's no harm in reiterating that

17
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:11,280
when the particles that compose a large scale

18
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,680
statistical system do not interact with each other,

19
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:17,520
enormous simplifications can result, which we've

20
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,800
seen even going back to week three on the

21
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,510
canonical ensemble.

22
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:33,530
How? With or in the absence of interactions, the

23
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,760
objects like the canonical partition function just

24
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:41,990
break up or factories into products of many

25
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:45,020
identical partition functions for each individual

26
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:48,200
product, which we only have to compute once and

27
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,700
are much easier to compute for one particle than

28
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:56,240
for a whole statistical ensembles worth of

29
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:56,870
particles.

30
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,320
Of course.

31
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,990
That's not interacting approximation, although it

32
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:12,890
can describe very well things like the the ferry

33
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:16,020
pressure that holds up white dwarf stars or the

34
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:19,890
spectrum of radiation emitted by the sun or by the

35
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:22,770
cosmic microwave background, it is still an

36
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:26,790
approximation to the real world in which objects

37
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:29,880
are able to interact with each other, is dancing

38
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,830
off each other rather than passing straight

39
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:36,120
through without realizing any other object is in

40
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,590
its way. And there are many important physical

41
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:44,010
phenomena that rely on the presence of

42
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:48,560
interactions. The one will be focusing on in in

43
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:51,930
this week's material is the concept of a phase

44
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:55,290
transition where systems composed of the same

45
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:59,190
particles can exhibit extremely different

46
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:03,870
Large-Scale behavior depending on the control

47
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:07,320
parameters that we've seen before, things like the

48
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,400
pressure and temperature

49
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:13,410
and depending on, say, the temperature, we can

50
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:17,610
have water molecules, H2O that behave like a

51
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:22,020
liquid of water or like a solid ice or even like a

52
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:25,950
gas in the form of steam. There are many other

53
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:28,800
examples ranging from the courts on plasma in the

54
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:35,370
early universe to Byler graphene in in physics

55
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:38,700
labs just down the road here, where there are

56
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:42,750
these transitions between two different types of

57
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,550
behavior in the case of graphene.

58
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:49,140
Electrical insulator that does not allow electric

59
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:52,260
field to flow versus a superconductor that allows

60
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,500
an electric field to flow with no electrical

61
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,230
resistance or no loss of energy in the form of

62
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:04,320
heat. And in all of these cases, the interactions

63
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:07,890
between the particles in these systems play a key

64
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:13,160
role. And we will. Get a grip on this with our

65
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,040
usual spin system that was introduced all the way

66
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:21,770
back in week three or week to even analyzing the

67
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:25,610
canonical ensemble in week three, where in the.

68
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:31,540
Not attract, in case we just had this expression,

69
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:35,380
for the energy of the system in an external field

70
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:42,490
of strength h where we will assume that all of the

71
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,270
spins are distinguishable by their location in a

72
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:50,470
fixed grid or a lattice such as the the two

73
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:54,660
dimensional lattice that is drawn here. We can

74
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:59,250
label each of these spins by its position and see

75
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:03,930
whether it is pointing upwards. We'll give a value

76
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:06,300
of plus one or pointing downwards, which

77
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,970
corresponds to a value of minus one. This is for a

78
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:12,810
two dimensional lattice and mathematically at

79
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:16,140
least, we can define a lattices of any dimension.

80
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:21,270
From zero to infinity, though, only one, two and

81
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:23,730
three dimensional lattices are physically

82
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:26,730
realizable in the three spatial dimensions that we

83
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:33,170
live in. So to get a start, we. Intuitively have

84
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:35,000
an understanding of what it means for particles

85
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,770
not to interact with each other, they don't even

86
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:41,360
realize each other, are there? We can put this on

87
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,220
a more rigorous mathematical footing by defining a

88
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,700
system to be not interacting. If the change in its

89
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:53,270
total energy that results from some change in one

90
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:56,600
particular degree of freedom is independent of all

91
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,000
of the other degrees of freedom in the system,

92
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:04,760
which is easy to check for. That system of and not

93
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,850
interacting spins the change in the energy upon

94
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:11,480
changing spin. I am the only possible way depends

95
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,760
only on speed. I am not from any of the others.

96
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:18,290
But if we add terms that multiply together two or

97
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:23,590
more spins. Then this will no longer be the case.

98
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,650
In the simplest possible interaction, given the

99
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:33,200
the lattice structure mentioned just above, is to

100
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:37,420
suppose that. Only pairs of spins can interact, so

101
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:41,560
there's there are no terms in the energy that have

102
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:46,530
more than two factors of s multiplied together,

103
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,870
and we also assume that spins interact only with

104
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:54,000
the spins that are closest to them in that fixed

105
00:06:54,010 --> 00:07:00,360
structure of the lattice. So this defines a. So

106
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:03,650
called nearest neighbor Perre, which is maybe

107
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:06,530
easiest to get a handle on with some pictures,

108
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:10,340
where if we pick out one skin in a two dimensional

109
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:16,150
lattice, we can see that it has. For nearest

110
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:18,760
neighbors that are the same distance away from,

111
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:22,570
it's the next closest site after that is a route

112
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:25,900
to factor further away, about 40 percent along

113
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:28,600
that diagonal. And we can.

114
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,690
Take or introduced an accounting for these nearest

115
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:38,650
neighbors by defining what are called links that

116
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:42,820
connect these nearest neighbor pairs of so-called

117
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:48,040
sites where the spin degrees of freedom live. And

118
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:51,190
there are similar concepts like placates or cubes

119
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:56,670
for two or three dimensional human cells. With a

120
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:58,650
bit of accounting.

121
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:06,680
We can figure out how many terms there are in the.

122
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:11,960
Energy, we have generalize here to include a

123
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:15,410
nearest neighbor, sphincter interaction, and in

124
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:15,910
this it's.

125
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:20,610
A simplification is provided by imagining that the

126
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:27,180
Latisse is. Connected to itself along its edges

127
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:30,750
are glued together. You could say similarly to

128
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:33,660
that old video game, Pacman. I'm sure many other

129
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:36,990
video games where if you run off one side of the

130
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:42,050
screen, you just appear. At the same height on the

131
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:45,740
other side of the screen in this corresponds to

132
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,910
introducing extra links between the sites that one

133
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:53,750
edge connected to the sites of the other edge,

134
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:57,260
that these sites are now considered themselves

135
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:00,650
nearest neighbors. All the sites are therefore the

136
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:03,290
same. You don't have to worry about whether or not

137
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:05,600
they may be on the boundary. And it's easy to

138
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,560
count how many links there are in any number of

139
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,530
dimensions. And the only lattice structure we're

140
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:17,030
considering is the simple cubic lattice, which,

141
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:20,450
with periodic boundary conditions, is existing on

142
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:24,050
a dimensional hyperfocus, which is a top logically

143
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:26,270
flat surface that doesn't introduce any

144
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:29,900
complications itself. So with those

145
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,960
simplifications, we can just by inspecting this

146
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:36,500
picture, see that an instant system with periodic

147
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:40,160
boundary conditions in one dimension involves in

148
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:43,760
Linc's or in nearest neighbor pairs. That

149
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:48,110
increases to two and in two dimensions. And you

150
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:51,740
can work out the generalization to an arbitrary

151
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:56,750
number of dimensions. So this system is is known

152
00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:01,400
as the easy model, which to my knowledge is the

153
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,160
simplest possible interacting system we can

154
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,670
consider. And in part for that reason, it has been

155
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:11,870
used and continues to be used in thousands of

156
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:16,370
scientific studies where the interactions matter.

157
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:20,330
But the interactions can be modeled just by this

158
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:25,130
simple nearest neighbor interaction of spin's. And

159
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:26,720
there is a.

160
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:33,690
Well, a story that I find very interesting

161
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:37,260
historically around the development and

162
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,740
understanding of this, this model, it was not

163
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:46,320
until really the 1960s that it was realized the

164
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,010
easy model could. Provide a very good

165
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:54,240
approximation to a vast array of systems, both

166
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:58,530
within and beyond mathematical sciences, including

167
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:05,370
things like social sciences and in biology, and

168
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:11,730
maybe as a reflection of. Or one aspect of this

169
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:14,640
history to take away is just how hard it is to

170
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,690
solve even such a simple system exactly in a

171
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:21,990
closed form expression. So this was in one

172
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:24,180
dimension. It's not so hard. It was done as a

173
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:29,190
project for the fellow or by the fellow using

174
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,390
whose name is now attached to the model. But the

175
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,930
the two dimensional solution, even in a simple

176
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:39,300
case for the external magnetic field, was turned

177
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:43,020
off and said to zero was not completed until the

178
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:48,480
1940s in work by Lawrence Einziger. That is

179
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:54,210
a famously difficult calculation and has not yet

180
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,760
and may be impossible to reproduce in of three to

181
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:02,970
three dimensions or higher numbers of dimensions.

182
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:05,520
Now.

183
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:13,360
Yeah, and. Another reflection of the difficulty of

184
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,700
solving these interacting systems is that now

185
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:19,030
instead of being able to consider a single spin

186
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:22,030
and then just multiply the resulting partition

187
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:25,330
function to get the overall partition function for

188
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:29,080
an instant system, that factorization is no longer

189
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:33,160
possible because of this quadratic term and spins.

190
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:37,510
And we have to really consider how many terms

191
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:42,400
there are in the partition function that sums over

192
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:46,420
all possible microstates, all of the possible ways

193
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:52,510
the end spins can be orientated. And if we try to

194
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,690
solve this numerically with the computer the way

195
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:58,720
you did for anomalous diffusion in your project.

196
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:03,030
You can pretty easily estimate that it would take

197
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:06,540
even for simple systems with hundreds or thousands

198
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:11,850
of of particles far below the typical number, ten

199
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:14,760
to the twenty three that shows up in any physical

200
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:20,640
systems, a calculation exactly. Evaluating this

201
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,860
partition function numerically on a modern

202
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:27,180
computer or indeed any computer that can possibly

203
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:31,050
be foreseen would take far longer than the age of

204
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:36,690
the universe. So rather than attempting a an exact

205
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:41,400
solution in our work for this week, we'll just

206
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:47,710
quickly consider the. Two limits, as we did in

207
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:51,730
week three of high and low temperature and at high

208
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:57,370
temperatures of the partition function is. Quite

209
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:03,580
easy to evaluate, and we find that every possible

210
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:07,030
micro state effectively has varnishing energy and

211
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:11,250
equal probability. So in order to distinguish

212
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:15,570
between those different micro states, which we can

213
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:18,570
no longer tell them apart by looking at their

214
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:22,140
energy, which is sort of invisible underneath the

215
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,890
the thermal effects of that high temperature, we

216
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:28,680
can look at the magnetization, which is the

217
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:32,250
difference between how many spins are pointing in

218
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:36,000
one direction versus how many are pointing in the

219
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,490
other direction. And if we normalize by the total

220
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:41,370
number of spins, that the magnetization is between

221
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:44,790
zero and one. So in the high-temperature phase,

222
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:49,110
because the all of the microstates are equally

223
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:53,130
probable and there are many more microstates with

224
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,520
approximately equal numbers of up and down

225
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:00,960
pointing spins, we predict that the magnetization

226
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:05,670
will vanish. And this is called a disordered phase,

227
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:10,020
reflecting that relatively equal number of up and

228
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:12,660
down putting spins which can be distributed

229
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:16,280
randomly or the disordered way throughout the the

230
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:20,900
lattice. And not surprisingly, in low temperatures,

231
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:25,220
we end up with a so-called order order phase, and

232
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:28,970
this is this follows from the sort of calculation

233
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:32,870
that we did in week three, looking at the low

234
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:35,990
energy ground states and the the first excited

235
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:40,220
states of these systems and seeing that the ground

236
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:42,260
states where all the spins are aligned and the

237
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:46,370
organization takes its maximum value, one is

238
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:49,100
dominant with only exponentially suppressed

239
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:53,300
effects coming in from excited states with with

240
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:57,950
higher energies and smaller monetizations. So

241
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:05,780
as the temperature changes from high to low, the

242
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,480
large scale system or the large scale behavior of

243
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,360
the system changes from being disordered with

244
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,470
varnishing magnetization to being ordered with a

245
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:22,310
nearly maximal magnetization, which identifies the

246
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:25,100
magnetization as what is known as an order

247
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:29,660
parameter distinguishing between the possible

248
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:33,080
phases of the system, whether it is disordered or

249
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:33,740
disordered.

250
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:44,600
It is. Possible for.

251
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:52,370
There to be. Two different or two distinct ways of

252
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:55,490
getting it from one of those phases to the other,

253
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,760
one of which is a bona fide hit phase transition

254
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:02,600
and the other of which is a a gradual and smooth

255
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:08,540
evolution that is is called a crossover in in the

256
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:13,190
lingo where the the rigorous definition of a phase

257
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:16,010
transition involves the appearance of a

258
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:18,260
discontinuity, either in the order parameter

259
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:22,250
itself or in derivatives of the order parameter

260
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:26,870
with respect to control parameters. In the case of

261
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:31,190
the using model, the only control parameter in the

262
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:34,520
zero field limit is the temperature in any phase,

263
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,790
transition with a discontinuity would occur at a

264
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,230
so-called critical temperature.

265
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:48,450
So the two. Most common types of face transitions

266
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:52,050
are known as first order and second order. We're

267
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:54,040
in a first sort of phase transition, the order

268
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:58,180
parameter itself is this is discontinuous at that

269
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:00,370
critical temperature with a.

270
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,570
Not varnishing jump happening

271
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:09,490
as the temperature passes through the critical

272
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:12,460
temperature to see a second order phase transition,

273
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:16,060
the order itself is continuous, but it has a kink

274
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:20,260
at the critical temperature that corresponds to a

275
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:23,650
discontinuity or a divergence in its first

276
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:28,690
derivative. And we will see in the next video,

277
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:31,090
which I suspect will be shorter than this one,

278
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,200
that.

279
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:41,360
The easy model. In two or more dimensions has

280
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,150
precisely this second order phase transition in

281
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:46,820
its order parameter of the magnetization.
