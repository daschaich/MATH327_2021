1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:06,390
So I will get the recording started and wait for a

2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:10,350
little while in case there are questions from you,

3
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:14,070
anything lingering from last time or arising from

4
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:19,200
the asynchronous materials to to bring up today

5
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:20,940
and

6
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:26,430
to give you a little while to think about that and

7
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:30,270
just reiterate that you can feel free to put it on

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,340
hold everywhere. A question that has been linked

9
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,540
in the chat window directly in the chat window, or

10
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,790
just go ahead and undo yourselves and speak up

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,970
whatever is most convenient for you, this is your

12
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:49,710
secret session to get the maximal use out of. And

13
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:56,010
it's the only logistical notice today is just the

14
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:00,960
reminder that the first homework assignment is due

15
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,700
next Tuesday. That's the 16th. So a little over

16
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,960
five days away, this will be a bit more of the

17
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,810
sort of assignment you were used to as opposed to

18
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,360
that computer project, which are still being

19
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,360
marked. Should get back over the weekend. Well, in

20
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,210
time for the term break, along with the second

21
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:22,830
part of that assignment.

22
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:37,470
And to continue giving you a bit of an opportunity

23
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:43,140
to raise any questions that you may have, don't

24
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,680
worry about interrupting me. If you do have any

25
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,790
questions I can give you. Recap the

26
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,530
material we went through earlier this week or

27
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:59,400
Monday, synchronous session where we wrapped up

28
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,880
the ideal gas law as an example of the equation of

29
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,830
states and got through about the first half of the

30
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:11,370
year synchronous material on thermodynamic cycles

31
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:15,000
that are based on that ideal gas law, along with

32
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:21,280
other aspects of ideal gases. How their entropy is

33
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,050
kept constant and

34
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:28,360
in the first law of thermodynamics, generalized

35
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,880
for the canonical ensemble where the energy is

36
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:38,140
allowed to fluctuate. By exchange with a large

37
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:42,620
reservoir that fixes the temperature. And we saw

38
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:47,590
it in the first half of the week, five material

39
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:48,590
how?

40
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:54,510
Work and heat are formally defined and enter into

41
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:59,070
that generalized first law of thermodynamics,

42
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:09,480
where the change in energy is simply given by the

43
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:15,060
heat and work that are being done by the system.

44
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:22,270
And how these changes in the the large scale

45
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:27,100
macroscopic state of the limbic system can be

46
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:31,780
represented graphically in the form of pressure,

47
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:35,830
volume, diagrams or PV diagrams, a couple of

48
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:39,850
examples of which were where we left off on page

49
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:46,350
75. And while I was going through that recap

50
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:52,360
question did come in for the first get on page 80,

51
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:57,250
looking at the work done in the adiabatic

52
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:02,170
expansion of the Karno cycle. So we will. Get to

53
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:06,940
that, I think, today and. Building up to that

54
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:13,650
might be. Useful just to consolidate the stuff

55
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:17,750
that came up on Monday and combine these PV

56
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:24,420
diagrams with. The definition of work in heat by.

57
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:27,460
Asking to see.

58
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:36,990
A fairly technical question, so say that I have

59
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:44,220
some gas in some volume that I want to present, I

60
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:52,290
want to compress this ideal gas in some volume and

61
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:55,560
say also that I'm lazy and I want to do this

62
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,340
compression while doing the least amount of work

63
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:00,900
possible.

64
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,590
So I'm I have to exert some force on the container

65
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:11,070
holding this ideal gas to reduce its volume. I

66
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:13,680
don't really care about how much the volume is

67
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,280
reduced, how long it takes me to reduce that

68
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:22,470
volume. Just want to consider what strategy I

69
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:28,780
should take to make the. Compression is easy as

70
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:32,740
possible for me with the thought of two limiting

71
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:36,160
cases being to compress that volume quickly so

72
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,810
that no heat is expelled as I exert this force on

73
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:44,680
it. Alternately, I could and the other extreme

74
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,470
compress it very slowly. So that heat is always

75
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:50,110
being exchanged between this gas and surroundings

76
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:54,430
and as a consequence, its temperature stays fixed.

77
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:57,760
Or I could do something in between that balances

78
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:01,150
these two considerations of of temperature and

79
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:01,770
heat flow.

80
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:08,680
And so there's not any.

81
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:14,870
Detailed calculation that needs to be done for

82
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:22,760
this, and it's just a more conceptual and generic

83
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:28,200
question. Of the relation between. Compression,

84
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,950
heat and work will give you a little while to

85
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,110
think about those relations.

86
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:45,780
Or to ask any questions if the set up being

87
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,180
proposed here is unclear.

88
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,570
And at this point, I think there are enough

89
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:35,620
responses to see that a consensus is developing

90
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:39,160
but not unanimous around the option of slow

91
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:42,090
compression so that the temperature stays the same.

92
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:47,840
Indeed, the graphical way to see this on this TV

93
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:52,730
diagram we were looking at at the end of last

94
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:57,200
week's session is by recalling that the work is.

95
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:02,160
The. Negative of the.

96
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:09,090
Pressure times, the change in volume integrated

97
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,470
over that.

98
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:16,730
Whatever that compression is, so in other words,

99
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:19,700
with the volume on the horizontal axis of this TV

100
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,880
diagram, the work is just the.

101
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:33,980
It is related to the area under the curve, drawn

102
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:36,890
by the line and perhaps using blue.

103
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:46,080
Coloring, I should just fill in the area under

104
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:51,660
that isothermal curve where what we have to do

105
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:55,950
with the negative sign is just keep track of which

106
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:58,980
direction we are going, whether we are compressing

107
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:04,890
or expanding the gas, where if we were expanding

108
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:07,650
the gas, we would have the usual integral from a

109
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:12,030
small volume to a large volume. The integral then

110
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,040
would be the positive area under the graph, and

111
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:17,610
the negative sign would be an overall negative

112
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:21,330
sign indicating that work was being done by the

113
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:22,770
system on its surroundings.

114
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,190
Since we're going in the other direction and

115
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:30,100
compressing the gas, I can see that the smallest

116
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,170
amount of work, which is the smallest area,

117
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:37,150
corresponds to that isothermal line and any.

118
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:44,530
Any change in the temperature is going to open up

119
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:48,910
some other additional region on this diagram,

120
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,420
contributing additional work that has to be done.

121
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:56,320
So that's the the mathematical response in terms

122
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,310
of integration. In the the more physical response

123
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,660
would be that.

124
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:11,910
By allowing the heat to flow, we are familiar with

125
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:14,280
the relation between heat and temperature. We're

126
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:18,240
lowering the temperature of the gas, keeping it

127
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,910
constant in the isothermal limit. And by lowering

128
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:28,620
the temperature, we lower the pressure by the

129
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:32,310
ideal gas law. So by keeping the temperature

130
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:34,980
constant, we have to do less work pushing up that

131
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:41,280
pressure compared to what we would do if he were

132
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,040
allowed, if no heat were allowed to exchange to

133
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:48,180
flow and the pressure were pushed all the way up

134
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:52,500
to that maximum value resulting from the adiabatic

135
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,910
limit. So

136
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,780
with that

137
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:05,700
seeming clear to everyone, we can maybe consider a

138
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:08,130
slightly different and more

139
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:15,180
abstract question, which comes now from the

140
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,570
generality of these PV diagrams. They provide an

141
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:25,410
easy way to define thermodynamic cycles with all

142
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:28,230
sorts of different behavior, some of which is

143
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:32,430
physically motivated, some of which may be a more

144
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:38,040
mathematical abstraction. So, for example, we

145
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:42,210
could consider just the abstract cycle that

146
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:47,650
corresponds to the following close loop in apre

147
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:48,390
diagram.

148
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:54,690
Where?

149
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:01,550
I'm drawing this so that each of these three lines

150
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:02,390
is

151
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,910
meant to be a straight line, one of them at a

152
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:10,790
constant volume, one of them at a constant

153
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:17,090
pressure, and the other going along the diagonal,

154
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,340
connecting those two.

155
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:25,570
Limits of the cycle and the question to ask is

156
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:27,160
whether this triangular cycle.

157
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:34,380
Performs work on its surroundings as we go across

158
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:39,100
around the cycle over and over again. Alternately,

159
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,940
it's possible that the cycle would require work to

160
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:46,750
be done on it by its surroundings in order to

161
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:48,370
successfully complete.

162
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,730
Or it could just be a wash, a balance between.

163
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:58,520
The work that the cycle does on its surroundings

164
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:03,140
and the work that has to be done on it by those of

165
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:06,890
us from outside of joining forces and

166
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:14,420
doing work on the system to to get it to close as

167
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,560
it goes all the way around.

168
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:35,290
You know, I'll give you some time to think about

169
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:37,750
that or ask for clarifications if.

170
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,830
What I've described is unclear.

171
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:10,130
I see responses are coming in and moving around,

172
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:14,060
so I'll wait a bit longer for things to settle

173
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:14,410
down.

174
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:42,770
And if we take a look and the results, there's not

175
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:47,120
quite an even split, but a variety of responses,

176
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:54,740
there's anyone able and willing to motivate their

177
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:57,500
choice before I motivate mine.

178
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:49,070
Not hearing any volunteers will flip back to the

179
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:54,730
illustration of this diagram to consider and see

180
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:55,420
if I can.

181
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:02,920
Zoom out to, well, it's legitimate far enough to

182
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:06,250
get the equations back on the screen. It'll be a

183
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:10,300
bit awkward. I can write them again

184
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:18,100
just as easily. Was that the work was.

185
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:25,800
The negative integral over the volume of that

186
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:29,460
pressure as a function of the volume or the area

187
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:37,010
on these PV diagrams. Up to considerations of that

188
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:41,870
overall negative sign, so I drew this triangle

189
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:47,120
starting from this point in going along this

190
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:50,990
diagonal path where we increase the volume and

191
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:56,030
increase the pressure simultaneously, the at least

192
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:58,760
the magnitude of the work that's being done is the

193
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,500
area under.

194
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:04,380
That's.

195
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:11,270
Diagonal line. And then the question is, how did

196
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:15,110
the science work out to tell whether this process

197
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:19,280
is doing work on its surroundings or requires work

198
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,220
being input to the gas by the surroundings in

199
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,020
order to happen?

200
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:25,450
Well.

201
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:29,470
If we.

202
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,850
Recall the cartoon that we started off with of a

203
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,470
gas in.

204
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:43,560
A.

205
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:53,180
In Volume one. All of which was a. Movable piston.

206
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:59,580
That is how we allow this volume to. Expand or

207
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:03,630
contract as the volume increases in the piston

208
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:07,960
moves outward. That can be connected to some gears,

209
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:11,920
doing work on the surroundings. It's pushing out

210
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:15,370
into the external environment, shifting whatever

211
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:19,900
is there away from where it was sitting. This is

212
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:24,520
caused by the gas heating up, energy being added

213
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:30,010
in the form of of heat. So along this diagonal

214
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:37,990
line here, heat is coming in and work is going out,

215
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:43,570
being done on the surroundings by the expansion of

216
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:44,320
our system.

217
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,030
So the overall.

218
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:53,140
Work that is being done is the area under this

219
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:58,070
diagonal. Which comes with that overall negative

220
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:01,700
sign as we're integrating from a smaller, larger

221
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:05,480
volumes, so that is less than zero in this first

222
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,020
stage.

223
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:09,460
Which is the.

224
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:15,290
Sign that corresponds to work being done by the

225
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:20,340
system on its surroundings. Now, when we get up to

226
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,910
the end of that process and starts considering the

227
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:26,940
next one, what happens there is that we fix that

228
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:32,670
volume, locking that piston into place and allow

229
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:37,080
the system to cool. It loses energy in the form of

230
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:41,040
heat flowing out into its core reservoir.

231
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,400
That lowers the temperature, that lowers the

232
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,090
pressure at a fixed volume, and because the volume

233
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:54,050
is fixed, this change in volume is zero in the

234
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:57,620
overall work being done to zero. So that is not

235
00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:01,300
relevant to the question of. Whether this cycle

236
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:04,600
performs more or less work than it requires to

237
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:08,080
operate, we can move straight ahead to the final

238
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,880
process where.

239
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:16,640
The volume now is being compressed, so the force

240
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,670
from the outside is being exerted on this piston

241
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:23,700
to squeeze the system into a smaller volume in

242
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,850
this compression is happening in such a way that

243
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:31,010
the pressure is constant. The easy way to

244
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:36,020
accomplish that is, well, that corresponds to just

245
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:39,290
exerting a constant force on this piston. If we

246
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:42,080
had drawn the orientation of the spikes the other

247
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,810
way around so that the pistons were on the top, we

248
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:47,180
could have just added a weight to it and let the

249
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:51,320
force of gravity do the compression for us. That

250
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,930
would guarantee you that the force was always

251
00:24:53,930 --> 00:25:00,080
constant. And as that constant force compresses

252
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:04,040
the volume by the ideal gas law, it tends to

253
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:07,700
increase the pressure. So we have to wait for

254
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:13,190
additional heat to leave the system of flowing out

255
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:14,780
back into that cold reservoir

256
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:19,940
so that the temperature and the pressure fall back

257
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,950
down again to the point that this constant force

258
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:25,040
is again able to do a little bit more compression.

259
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:32,170
So that corresponds to work being done, being done

260
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:34,960
on the system by surroundings that is being put

261
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,530
into the system. We can also see that now that

262
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:42,460
we're going in the opposite direction in our

263
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:45,760
integration from a larger volume to a smaller one.

264
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:53,370
That's overall. Work those two negative signs from

265
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:56,340
the limits of integration and from the cost factor

266
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:57,090
out front.

267
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:07,010
I mean, that in this stage, in this process of the

268
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:10,910
cycle, it has to be done on the system by its

269
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:15,540
surroundings. And the question now is. Which of

270
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:20,700
those two is larger you I should have told him

271
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:24,150
that this work going in, being done by the

272
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:28,410
surroundings, was the area under that horizontal

273
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:34,270
counterpressure line. So we can see that adding up

274
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:38,080
those two contributions with the relative sign the

275
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:43,360
area in the pre diagram traced out by the cycle.

276
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:51,360
Is the network being done? And that came that

277
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:55,240
comes from the area under the. First diagonal

278
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:58,150
process, but still above the final horizontal

279
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:02,410
process so that there is more work coming out,

280
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:05,830
being done by the system than there is work going

281
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:10,900
in, being done. On the system, so the cycle is

282
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:15,220
able to perform work, making its an engine rather

283
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:21,010
than a refrigerator, using external inputs of of

284
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:24,730
energy and work to shift heat from one place to

285
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:25,180
another.

286
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:34,560
In all that discussion of reservoirs and shifting

287
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:39,630
heats and so on was looking ahead a bit to the

288
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:42,300
final section in the material for this week, the

289
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:47,370
Karno cycle, which is a particularly famous

290
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:53,800
thought, a cycle that introduced. You know, even

291
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:57,340
before the concepts of heat and entropy were

292
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:01,690
mathematically well-defined, it introduced the

293
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:07,030
framework, the concept of the conceptual paradigm

294
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:09,760
that is still used by a lot of the real heat

295
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,360
engines

296
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:14,590
and not just heat engines, the real engines like

297
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:18,040
internal combustion engines that are used all over

298
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:22,240
in this modern age, featuring the system in

299
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:27,160
contact with two different thermal reservoirs,

300
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,960
a hot reservoir with a high temperature and a cold

301
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,460
reservoir with a low temperature.

302
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:39,890
That the system is in equilibrium with as it

303
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:41,690
expands and contracts.

304
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:51,330
In these now four stages, rather than the three of

305
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:54,360
the triangular cycle we were looking at, so maybe

306
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:58,050
before going into more detail with the Kano's

307
00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:01,710
cycle, I should pause and ask to see if there were

308
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:06,060
if the explanation of that triangular cycle was

309
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:09,000
satisfactory or if questions are lingering about

310
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:09,450
that.

311
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:48,180
Not hearing any questions, I took that opportunity

312
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:52,680
to draw in to this diagram some of the.

313
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:58,200
Information in the text about the set up for the

314
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:05,420
carto cycle. That makes it a particularly simple

315
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:10,910
and special system to consider where the expansion

316
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:15,500
from its smallest volume points A to its largest

317
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:21,260
volume point C proceeds in these two stages. First,

318
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:25,070
a slow isothermal expansion where.

319
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:29,320
Heat is.

320
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:33,690
Added to the system to keep the temperature

321
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:38,190
constant as the volume expands and just as we were

322
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:41,730
seeing with the previous cycle, that expansion of

323
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:45,450
the volume means that the system is able to do

324
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:48,930
work on its surroundings, putting out output work

325
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:55,350
that can be put to put to use in impractical

326
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:59,470
devices. At least in principle.

327
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:03,960
Then at some intermediate points that we've

328
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,240
labeled here, B, we switch from that slow

329
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,330
isothermal expansion to a fast adiabatic expansion

330
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,660
and we can recall the definition of adiabatic

331
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:17,280
processes are that no heat is exchanged so that

332
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:22,590
there is no change in the entropy. But still,

333
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:23,610
since this is.

334
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:33,500
A expansion, it is still doing work

335
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:39,440
on its surroundings, so work is being taken out of

336
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,860
the system and put to use in its surroundings and

337
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:47,240
then simply the the mirror image is done in

338
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:50,650
principle to get back to that starting point.

339
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:57,200
Where we do another round of slow isothermal

340
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,920
expansion, sorry, slow isothermal change in volume,

341
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:04,520
now we are compressing it, so work has to be so he

342
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:08,710
has to be expelled out into that cold reservoir

343
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:12,590
now to keep the temperature from increasing as the

344
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:14,540
system is compressed.

345
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:18,960
And this compression.

346
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:28,520
Itself requires work being put in, being done on

347
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:31,190
it, just as we've considered for.

348
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:35,320
The the question of.

349
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:40,260
Of compressing an arbitrary system with the least

350
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:42,930
amount of work possible at the start of today's

351
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:43,440
session.

352
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:06,060
I was just distracted by looking at some of the

353
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:09,030
questions about the Kerno cycle, the last stage

354
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:12,960
here is, again, that same adiabatic compression

355
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:17,220
with no heat exchange and still work being put in.

356
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:22,100
And I suspect a good.

357
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:30,960
Order which to to go through some of the

358
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:35,430
calculations for this system, which will address

359
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,680
the question that came in at the start of today's

360
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,540
session, is first to ask.

361
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:45,840
What is the the ratio of those?

362
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:52,540
Two temperatures for the carbon cycle, this is

363
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:57,980
something that ends up being. Uniquely determined

364
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:04,010
by the other properties of the system through the

365
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:06,950
key equations for summer Olympic cycles, the

366
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,500
conservation of energy, the first law of

367
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:14,170
thermodynamics. Definition of entropy and the

368
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:15,190
ideal gas law.

369
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:20,890
In this temperature ratio, we will see as we go

370
00:34:20,890 --> 00:34:25,210
through other aspects of considering this cycle

371
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:30,190
turns out to pop up in, you know, other sorts of

372
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:32,050
features of it.

373
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:28,510
Responses are coming in, so wait another minute or

374
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:28,920
so

375
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:35,770
and feel free to let me know if you are still

376
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:38,470
working, any need more time to consider this

377
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:39,040
question?

378
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:47,220
If I flip back to the current state of the results

379
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:47,580
there.

380
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:56,910
Is a bit of a spread. Does anyone? Want to explain

381
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:57,570
to us.

382
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:06,740
How any one of these. Three options, they got some

383
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:09,440
support were were derived.

384
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:41,390
Well, I can take a stab at it myself, partly in

385
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:45,890
the interest of time, so that we can get through a

386
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:51,020
couple more things today and just have one left

387
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:51,560
for

388
00:38:53,630 --> 00:39:00,410
for one day, so. This is the. This box here at the

389
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:05,040
top of page 78 is the one asking about. The low

390
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:10,710
temperature T.L. in terms of the the inputs,

391
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:14,850
quantities that we were given, and we're also told

392
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:19,440
here that the entropy is the same at points B and

393
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,370
C, one of which we might recall had that high

394
00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:27,940
temperature. The other, the low temperature going

395
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:35,040
from B to C, so that gives us access to. The low

396
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:41,550
temperature at point C. In terms of the high

397
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:44,220
temperature at point B, just recalling the

398
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:50,730
condition for the entropy to be constant is that

399
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:55,380
this combination of volume and temperature for a

400
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:59,130
constant entropy I might have misspoken earlier of

401
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:01,950
entropy means that this combination

402
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:09,200
of volume and temperature is fixed. Which then

403
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:16,190
tells us just rearranging this, that the ratio of

404
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:17,150
the temperatures.

405
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:21,860
Low temperature to the high temperature is given

406
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:26,420
directly by this ratio of the volumes with the

407
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:32,800
two thirds power taken to cancel out. That's that

408
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:35,900
three 1/2 hour on the temperature in the course of

409
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:39,860
entropy condition, which was the the most popular

410
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:42,590
response in this whole.

411
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:52,790
And with this set up and skip ahead to. The

412
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:57,050
question that came in. At the start of today's

413
00:40:57,050 --> 00:41:01,460
session, looking at the first box on page 80,

414
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:06,440
where the question here is motivated by

415
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:08,720
considering the efficiency of the kanoa cycle,

416
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:11,810
which will wrap up on Monday, I suspect.

417
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:19,330
But we've seen in the setup for computing the work

418
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:23,190
being done by this adiabatic expansion from point

419
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:27,310
A to point C, because no heat is exchanged in that

420
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:33,270
adiabatic process, the work is. Exactly the change

421
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:36,930
in the internal energy of the gas, which from one

422
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:40,680
of those key equations in a box earlier in this

423
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:44,220
document, is just driven by the change in

424
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:50,000
temperature going from theart to. T. high to see

425
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,540
low THC l since that number of.

426
00:41:56,700 --> 00:42:00,300
Of particles in in the system is always fixed and

427
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:04,020
we end at the low temperature and start at the

428
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:08,900
high temperature going from point B to C. Which

429
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:14,420
means that if we pull out that factor of the high

430
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:18,050
temperature, we have just our

431
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:25,460
ratio that we just computed here that he low over

432
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,500
t hard we can recognize. This combination of end

433
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:35,660
times to high as the input, pressure and volume

434
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:42,280
from the ideal gas law. At either point A to point

435
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:45,250
B, they both have the same number of particles and

436
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:50,740
the same high temperature and then plugging in the

437
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:54,970
result we just had for that temperature ratio in

438
00:42:54,970 --> 00:42:59,860
terms of those volumes to the power two thirds, we

439
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:03,580
have that result for the work being done by the

440
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:07,540
idiomatic expansion and we can check to see.

441
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:13,400
That's because this is expansion of the volume at

442
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:18,530
point C v subsea is larger than the volume and B,

443
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:24,070
this ratio is less than one. When it's raised to

444
00:43:24,910 --> 00:43:28,450
any power remains less than one, so the overall

445
00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:35,100
factor within the. Parentheses here is negative on

446
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:40,800
the whole. So with the work being negative, we

447
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:45,840
confirm that this is work being put out by the

448
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:48,630
system being done on its surroundings.

449
00:43:56,490 --> 00:43:59,940
I'll pause briefly for any questions about that

450
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:07,840
and. While waiting to hear, I will. Just spin up

451
00:44:07,850 --> 00:44:11,640
the the last question to ask today, which is.

452
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:23,040
Going back to the set up for the Karno cycle, we

453
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:26,610
skipped ahead a bit when computing hits its work

454
00:44:26,610 --> 00:44:29,010
there just because that was so closely related to

455
00:44:29,010 --> 00:44:32,370
the temperature ratio. There is a

456
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:39,330
in principle, a question that we should ask before.

457
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:42,920
Spending a lot of efforts trying to figure out how

458
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:45,710
much work this cycle is able to do in general,

459
00:44:45,710 --> 00:44:50,270
which is is it a well-defined thermodynamic cycle

460
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:55,010
in principle? Is it possible to. Align the

461
00:44:55,010 --> 00:44:57,830
sequence of isothermal and adiabatic expansion and

462
00:44:57,830 --> 00:45:00,440
compression in such a way that the system gets

463
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:03,650
back exactly to its starting macro state and the

464
00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:08,150
cycle can can be repeated over and over again

465
00:45:08,570 --> 00:45:13,010
without. Spinning off, either requiring an

466
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:15,830
infinite amount of work or an infinite amount of

467
00:45:15,830 --> 00:45:16,220
heat.

468
00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:27,630
And I guess it's not a spoiler to say that the

469
00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:31,050
Kado cycle is a well defined cycle, but this is

470
00:45:31,050 --> 00:45:38,700
only true for a particular choice. Of the the

471
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:44,720
final unspecified volume up in. The diagram, the

472
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,790
Peevey diagram that we started off with.

473
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:52,460
Up on page seventy six.

474
00:45:55,550 --> 00:46:02,000
Depending on how we choose that free volume, we

475
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,920
may or may not get a well-defined thermodynamic

476
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:10,310
cycle that can be put to work either as an engine

477
00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:11,450
or a refrigerator.

478
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,830
A couple of responses had already come in, and

479
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:49,480
since we're getting close to the end of time, I

480
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:52,660
won't wait too much longer for more consideration

481
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:55,750
unless there are requests that I do so.

482
00:47:49,110 --> 00:47:53,040
And there is agreement here that

483
00:47:55,110 --> 00:47:57,960
the condition is that the the ratios of these

484
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:03,060
volumes match up, which in case anyone didn't have

485
00:48:03,510 --> 00:48:08,500
time to. To check this in and vote here, that's

486
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:12,130
just coming from applying that same concept,

487
00:48:12,130 --> 00:48:14,590
entropy condition now to hearing about a

488
00:48:14,590 --> 00:48:18,940
compression going from point D to point A.

489
00:48:26,430 --> 00:48:30,210
Where the cost of entropy condition is that same

490
00:48:30,210 --> 00:48:33,090
relation between the volumes and the temperatures,

491
00:48:33,330 --> 00:48:40,890
so that video is VÉ times, this ratio of high and

492
00:48:40,890 --> 00:48:43,140
low temperatures to the power three halves.

493
00:48:50,710 --> 00:48:55,780
Which we just saw was exactly that ratio

494
00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:01,450
of the two specified volumes on the other

495
00:49:01,450 --> 00:49:05,870
adiabatic cycle, the. The expansion phase that

496
00:49:05,870 --> 00:49:11,270
does work. Leading to the constellation that the

497
00:49:12,890 --> 00:49:15,890
ratio of volumes at high temperatures for the

498
00:49:15,890 --> 00:49:19,440
Kano's cycle. Is.

499
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:28,700
A and B rather than A and D is equal to the ratio

500
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:34,370
of volumes at the low temperatures D and C.

501
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,860
And that brings us to the end of time, Will.

502
00:49:43,470 --> 00:49:47,070
Discuss the efficiency of the carto cycle on one

503
00:49:47,070 --> 00:49:51,630
day and have plenty of time to dive into the grand

504
00:49:51,630 --> 00:49:54,030
canonical ensemble and any questions about the

505
00:49:54,030 --> 00:50:01,300
homework do. On Tuesday and. If there are any

506
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:05,790
further questions now, feel free to. To ask them

507
00:50:05,790 --> 00:50:08,550
and I will in a few minutes, shut down the zoo

508
00:50:08,550 --> 00:50:11,700
meeting, extract that recording and then restarted

509
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:15,690
again for the usual office hours. So those of you

510
00:50:15,690 --> 00:50:18,720
without questions can enjoy the rest of your day.
