1
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:07,070
OK, that recording should be under way and we'll

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:12,340
get set up with the usual logistical notes and

3
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,680
the chance in the chat window to

4
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:24,980
Have any input on the direction that those of you

5
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:31,430
who are here live, want this last session to go.

6
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:37,450
So if there are a couple of. Directions that we

7
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:42,220
could go today, one being. Circling back to the

8
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:45,550
weekend stuff on the Medfield approximation that

9
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:47,860
sort of skipped over on Monday in favor of talking

10
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:52,150
about numerical Montecarlo calculations, the other

11
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:57,560
main thrust would be an overall review of. Of the

12
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:02,630
past 11 weeks, the volatile material with an eye

13
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:07,910
toward the final assessment coming up. And I think

14
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:10,730
if there are no strong preference is expressed

15
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:14,300
through Zob or that way everywhere, I would

16
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,670
probably go through them in that order. Touching

17
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:19,850
on the bean field approximation as the last major

18
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:22,400
components of the.

19
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:27,290
The material that has not really been discussed in

20
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:32,090
much depth in previous synchronous sessions while.

21
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:38,680
You have that opportunity to. Make your feelings

22
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:43,330
felt, can you give a few more logistical notes,

23
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:47,740
first of which being that the second part of the

24
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,980
computer project is now finally graded and that

25
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:55,110
should have gotten back to you about 10 hours ago.

26
00:01:56,830 --> 00:02:01,240
And as always, no guarantee that I've done that

27
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,210
working perfectly. So feel free to get in touch

28
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:08,620
with me if you think I've. Made any mistakes by

29
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:11,680
going through it, either in your submission was

30
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,660
marked or the general solutions, I think in

31
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:19,510
general folks had a much easier time with this

32
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:21,880
parts than with the first part, probably

33
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:26,560
benefiting from the experience and model of how

34
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,170
that that first thought went. So there were not

35
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:32,710
really any very widespread and significant issues

36
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:36,460
that I noticed while going through things. The

37
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,570
solutions are up on the canvass sites and in the

38
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:43,810
usual place. So let me know if you have any

39
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:47,920
trouble finding those as well. The second homework

40
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,830
assignment is now what's being marked and that

41
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:54,940
should go more quickly without having to hop back

42
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:58,330
and forth between PDF submissions and code files

43
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:02,500
that should be wrapped up over the weekend and.

44
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:08,820
I guess there will be no more synchronous sessions

45
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:12,780
after that to provide general feedback if there

46
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:15,990
are big issues on the record and upload a little

47
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:21,780
supplementary video. But I will say that at the

48
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:25,800
end of the regular term schedule, at the end of

49
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,830
this week, I won't be doing office hours at the

50
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:31,740
usual time, the hour after each of these

51
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,000
synchronous sessions, but will be available by

52
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,960
appointment and asynchronously throughout the

53
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,500
assessment period. If there are questions about

54
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:48,270
that upcoming homework assignment being returned

55
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:54,510
or anything else in the module as a whole.

56
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:02,250
And, you know, just for the sake of recording a

57
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:05,840
couple of the. Questions and answers that came up

58
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,710
at the end of the previous session after I believe

59
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:14,210
the recording had already stopped the. Question

60
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:18,980
was that whether the final assessment would cover

61
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:22,270
the entire module or just the the portion of it

62
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:22,640
that.

63
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:28,040
It was not covered by those previous work

64
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,920
assignments, and the answer is that the entire

65
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:35,240
module is fair game to show up on that final

66
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,000
assessment. There are few enough questions that

67
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,180
not every aspect of it can be covered, but what is

68
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:45,430
covered can be drawn from any week in the term.

69
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:49,550
That said, there will not be any programming

70
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:52,550
component to the final assessment that all got

71
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:55,820
wrapped up just about a month ago with the end of

72
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,260
the computer project.

73
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:07,130
And not seeing or hearing any. Strong demands for.

74
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:14,260
What to to look at today? Just keep that. Pull up

75
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,210
and running in the background and check in on it

76
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:20,320
on occasion, and as always, you're welcome to

77
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:24,040
unmuted what questions and comments in the chat

78
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:29,860
window I will hop over to. Actually, the the last

79
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:34,810
bit of the week, 10 material that got skipped over

80
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:37,810
on Monday in favor of numerical methods, looking

81
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:43,510
at the Manfield approximation and also the.

82
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:51,470
Related issue that I think. Also got a little bit

83
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:54,860
shortchanged for lack of time, which is what?

84
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:59,270
Really rigorously and mathematically defines a

85
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:03,150
phase transition as opposed to just some

86
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:06,330
difference between the behavior of the system in

87
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:09,300
different regions of its control parameters. So we

88
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:14,940
did see previously that looking at the using model

89
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:19,590
as the simplest possible interacting theory in the

90
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:21,990
high and low temperature limits that we could

91
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,280
solve the very leading order, asymptotic behavior

92
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:29,370
with analytic approximations. Or we could carry

93
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:32,070
out numerical calculations, both of which

94
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:37,560
distinguish between two distinct types of behavior,

95
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:42,870
two different phases analogous to, say, the liquid

96
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:45,270
phase of water in the solid phase of ice. Both may

97
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,920
not have the same substance, but behaving

98
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:52,120
qualitatively differently in the easy model are a

99
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,320
parameter, just like the melting or freezing of

100
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:59,130
water is the temperature of the system or the

101
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:02,070
inverse temperature data. And at high temperatures,

102
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:09,960
we saw that the system is disordered and. Roughly

103
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,440
half of the spin's are pointing in each of the two

104
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:16,080
directions that they can point out in the absence

105
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,800
of an external magnetic field and there's sort of

106
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:25,380
no pattern or no large scale organization between

107
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,750
determining which direction spins or pointing it

108
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:32,580
is randomly decided for each thing. And we have. I

109
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,440
guess just as a quick reminder,

110
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:40,610
can pull up. This again, and look at the high

111
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:41,630
temperature limit where.

112
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:46,590
Each square here corresponds to a spin color,

113
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:49,080
black or white, for pointing up or down and at

114
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,040
high temperatures.

115
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:54,560
It's not the one that I want.

116
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:03,820
Circle this high temperature limit. Here, where

117
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:06,430
there's no large scale pattern in the orientation

118
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:10,900
of the stands, which is a disordered array of of

119
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:14,080
up and down 40 degrees of freedom and in low

120
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,800
temperatures, things are. Qualitatively different.

121
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:25,060
With all of the spins preferring to. Align in an

122
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:28,510
ordered rather than a disordered phase where these

123
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:33,780
two faces are distinguished. By the magnetization,

124
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:37,290
the difference between the number of appointing

125
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:40,530
and down appointing spins, which vanishes in the

126
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:46,260
disordered phase and is non-zero and it approaches

127
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:51,640
its maximum one in that order phase. So this

128
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,130
magnetization here is playing the role of a

129
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:56,500
parameter that tells us whether the system is

130
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,990
ordered or disordered, and because that sort of

131
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:05,860
order disorder behavior is fairly generic in a

132
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:10,870
large number of statistical systems, this

133
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:14,590
magnetization can be generalized or it serves as

134
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:17,650
an example of a more general concept of order

135
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:20,590
parameter, which, as it says on the tin, is a

136
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:23,050
parameter that tells us whether the system is

137
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:28,240
ordered or disordered in a phase transition is.

138
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:33,040
Formally defined by the presence of a

139
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:38,080
discontinuity. In this order parameter or.

140
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:48,370
Any of its derivatives? And this is. A. A way of

141
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:53,560
categorizing and defining these transitions as

142
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:59,260
opposed to a gradual, continuous crossover's. That

143
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:02,620
was developed around the mid 20th century by.

144
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:09,180
Two Russian physicist Lev Landow and Ginzberg

145
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,420
think the first name is Vitaly Ginzberg, but can't

146
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:16,770
quite recall. But it's the Ginzberg paradigm where

147
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:19,020
there is an order parameter that distinguishes

148
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:21,900
between these phases in a phase, transition is

149
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,120
present. If that were a parameter or its

150
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:30,800
derivatives have a discontinuity. And the the

151
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,960
points in the case of the easy model, the

152
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:36,620
temperature at which the discontinuity occurs, is

153
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:39,980
known as the critical points or more specifically,

154
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:43,690
the critical temperature. We can imagine systems

155
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:47,890
where there are multiple different control

156
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:49,750
parameters that we could have to play with, we

157
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,460
could adjust the pressure of the volume, the

158
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,710
external magnetic field, and in that

159
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:56,320
multidimensional parameter space, there could well

160
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,830
be one or more different points where our order

161
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:02,470
parameter exhibits this sort of discontinuity,

162
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:07,570
transitioning between different phases. So the

163
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:09,400
critical point is a more general concept that

164
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,730
specializes to the critical temperature in the

165
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:17,320
zero field easing model in the classification or

166
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:20,580
categorization that was developed by Orlando. And

167
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:24,340
Ginsburg was to say that when the order parameter

168
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:30,430
itself has a a finite jump, a discontinuity at

169
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:33,100
that critical point which is drawn in this right

170
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:36,970
hand plot in the form of the dotted line, we call

171
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:40,920
that a first order phase transition or a

172
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:44,340
discontinuous phase transition where the order

173
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:45,490
parameter OPIS

174
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:51,190
jumps all of a sudden from its non-zero value in

175
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:55,510
the ordered phase to zero value in the disordered

176
00:11:55,510 --> 00:12:00,870
phase, which of course implies. Similar

177
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:04,530
divergences in discontinuities in the derivatives

178
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:08,130
of this this sort of parameter, but it's also

179
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:13,110
possible for the order parameter to be continuous

180
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:17,520
at the phase transition, but to transition from

181
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:22,740
having a non-zero value to having a zero value

182
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:25,800
going from one place to another with a kink

183
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:33,090
where the first derivative exhibits a divergence.

184
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:34,780
And.

185
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:39,910
Not to spoil things, I think we already looked at

186
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:43,990
this last time that this so-called second order or

187
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:49,120
continuous phase transition is what the using

188
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:55,690
model exhibits in. Two or more dimensions where?

189
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:02,010
And in the two dimensional case, the make the

190
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:03,600
order parameter, which is the.

191
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:08,980
The magnetization that we've been talking about is

192
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:14,970
proportional to. The square root of the distance

193
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:18,590
away from that critical temperature. Whereas if

194
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:21,920
you take the first derivative, so obviously that

195
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,290
square roots is, in fact what is drawn in this

196
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:27,020
plot, it is a continuous function.

197
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:34,250
At that critical temperature where it goes from

198
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:37,550
that square independence to just being zero. But

199
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,050
if we look at the first derivative instead of the

200
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:43,140
square root, we end up with one over that square

201
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:47,430
root, which diverges as the quantity in

202
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:52,170
parentheses goes to zero as he approaches TCE from

203
00:13:52,170 --> 00:14:00,800
below. And. We can get a grip on. These

204
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:05,290
transitions by. Trying to simplify these

205
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:07,750
interactive theories in some way, so we saw that

206
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:11,140
there were simplifications very far from that

207
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,100
phase transition.

208
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,550
Once we get to temperatures that are very much

209
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:18,980
larger than the critical temperature, we're very

210
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:22,580
much smaller than the critical temperature and we

211
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:25,490
are solidly we can identify that we are solidly in

212
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:28,160
one or the other of those phases and extract some

213
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,310
of the leading asymptotic behavior, neglecting

214
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:33,770
higher order terms and some small parameter.

215
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:38,180
Both of those expansions are going to break down

216
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,670
around the phase transitions to something a bit

217
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:45,590
more clever has to be done to look at the phase

218
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:51,070
transition dynamics in themselves. And this

219
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:53,140
Medfield approximation that.

220
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:00,620
Was what we skipped over last time is. Another

221
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:03,890
fairly generically applicable method that can be

222
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:06,860
applied not only to the easy model, but to all

223
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:09,770
sorts of interacting systems of which the using

224
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:15,860
model is a or the simplest possible example. And

225
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:21,320
the way this proceeds is to sort of reorganise the.

226
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,860
The energy that defines the U.S. model and its

227
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:29,100
interaction, so we're still defining everything on

228
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:34,470
this simple cubic lattice in these dimensions and

229
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:39,210
just by adding and subtracting a expectation value

230
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:46,180
for the magnetization which. We've done a quick

231
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:48,460
derivation here to relate that to the average

232
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:51,370
spend. Which as a.

233
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:59,570
As a sum over all of the microstates in in the

234
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:02,600
definition of the expectation value, this

235
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,580
expectation value of the magnetization is

236
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:08,330
independent of any particular spin or spin

237
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:11,150
configuration. It is simply a function of the

238
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:17,660
control parameters, beta and H. Which we turn back

239
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:22,120
on to a non-zero. External fuel strength.

240
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,550
For the purpose of this exercise, so by adding and

241
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:32,650
subtracting that constant value for a particular.

242
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:38,170
Value of these control parameters, we can express

243
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:43,360
the overall energy of the U.S. model with a slight

244
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,720
change of design conventions to get things to line

245
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,640
up with the previous sections. Sorry for that

246
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:53,080
inconsistency or that a change in convention

247
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:56,680
midstream, but we are able to organize things in

248
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:01,210
terms of the fluctuations of spins about that,

249
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:04,460
every expectation value of the average

250
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,740
standardization.

251
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:08,600
Now.

252
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:14,420
Obviously, for the easy model where these spins

253
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:17,150
can take only the values plus or minus one.

254
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:22,110
Any individual term here, even expressed in this

255
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:27,330
way is going to be fluctuating in some way or it's

256
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:29,790
going to be exhibiting large fluctuations, no

257
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:33,060
matter what the mechanization is, it cannot be

258
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:35,430
close to both plus one and minus one

259
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:40,770
simultaneously. However, on average, when we

260
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:45,780
insert this quantity into the sum over all the

261
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:48,570
nearest neighbor pairs that are represented by the

262
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:52,410
links in the simple cubic model, the average

263
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:57,230
fluctuations we can conjecture are. A relatively

264
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:59,930
small it could be neglected in the specific

265
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:02,610
context of that, some of our nearest neighbor

266
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:07,730
repairs, and that leads to this minefield

267
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:12,970
approximation to the energy which. Is not or has

268
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:18,510
not yet been justified. This is simply a. I guess

269
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:21,240
sort of conjecture that this sort of.

270
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:28,300
Approximation is valid and applicable that the

271
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:33,750
fluctuations are small on average then. What we

272
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:39,180
end up with is a system with a constant value, a

273
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:41,550
constant contribution to the energy coming from

274
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:44,610
that expectation, value of the magnetization

275
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:49,800
squared minus just the sum of our spins coupled to

276
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:54,870
a a modified external field. That depends on the

277
00:18:54,870 --> 00:19:00,130
speed value of the spin. So this terminology of

278
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:05,440
Medfield approximation is something that arose

279
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,650
historically and can be.

280
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:13,770
Uses a mnemonic to remember that that's going on,

281
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:17,360
that an external field has been defined now

282
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:21,620
depending on that mean value of the average STED.

283
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,200
And.

284
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:30,780
There's a little box here to go through the

285
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:37,360
exercise of. Checking whether or not this Medfield

286
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,640
approximation is.

287
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,800
Is giving us an interacting or not a tracking

288
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:51,310
system, and just by noting that we have a constant

289
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:55,720
independent of the spin configuration and then the

290
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,030
same energy that we started off with, just with a

291
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,820
different or efficient and effective magnetic

292
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:07,940
field rather than the. The very magnetic field, we

293
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:12,050
can just reuse our result from the first

294
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:18,260
little gap in this week's material and immediately

295
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:22,880
write down that the change in energy upon changing

296
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,790
the degree of freedom in this case is just going

297
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:31,820
to be two times now, that effective magnetic field.

298
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:38,230
Rather than the bare magnetic field that we

299
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:40,690
started off with, so the only change is swapping

300
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:46,710
in an effective field rather than. The original

301
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:48,420
field, this is.

302
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:53,320
Independent of all spin's.

303
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:04,270
Apart from. The the one that got changed, which is

304
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:09,160
our definition of a non interacting system, so

305
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:13,230
this is sort of the. Magic of the Medfield

306
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:18,300
approximation, it is taking us from the

307
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:21,570
interacting system that is extremely difficult to.

308
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:27,050
And analytically, since a no longer factor rises

309
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:30,080
and all of the exponentially many terms in his

310
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:35,450
partition function have to be considered in in

311
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:39,740
full detail, the mean field approximation is able

312
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:44,720
to take us from that situation back to a non

313
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,250
interacting system that still know something about

314
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:54,680
the the dynamics that are due to that interaction.

315
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,890
By virtue of incorporating the.

316
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:08,430
Resulting magnetization in the effective. Magnetic

317
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:11,940
field that each of the spins are independently

318
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:16,600
coupling to. So that I probably should have put in

319
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:20,920
this material as one of those shaded boxes at the

320
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:24,790
Medfield approximation is taking us from an

321
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:27,730
interactive system back to the non interacting

322
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:34,380
case. But with. Some cleverness built in in that

323
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:37,860
definition of the non attraction theory to back up

324
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:41,670
some of the effects of these interactions that

325
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:44,820
were not able to handle explicitly.

326
00:22:51,880 --> 00:23:00,140
So. Going through and. And plugging in. The the

327
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:03,510
Medfield approximation of the energy into that

328
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:07,710
partition function, we again, as we should expect

329
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:11,370
for a non interacting theory, benefit from the

330
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:17,100
factorization. That we had just like back in.

331
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:23,250
In week two or three or four of the previous parts

332
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:27,450
of the of the module for introducing.

333
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:30,280
InterAction's and.

334
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,450
By relating the.

335
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:41,900
The magnetization of the order parameter to. The

336
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:46,430
resulting Medfield approximation of the petition

337
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:52,650
function. We can end up with or derive the self

338
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:54,270
consistency condition.

339
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:01,770
That basically pulls out the dependence on the

340
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:06,690
marginalization that has been built into the not

341
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:10,850
interacting structure of this theory, so I'll

342
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:14,430
quickly go through how that works rather than

343
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:21,300
setting it up as a helpful question, given the

344
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:27,060
size of the audience today, but by identifying

345
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:30,030
this overall magnetization.

346
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:41,240
In the partition function, we can. See that the.

347
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:45,350
Derivative of the Helmholtz free energy, this

348
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:49,970
minus whatever, Ryvita. Derivative with respect to

349
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:55,100
the external magnetic field strength. Of the log

350
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:56,400
of the petition function.

351
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:05,570
Is. As usual, for the derivative of a log, we pull

352
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:09,920
out whatever Z expand the partition function in

353
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:12,860
some overlapping configurations.

354
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:21,480
And then just have. Derivative of. Better times

355
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:24,670
that attracting. Term.

356
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:34,710
Nearest neighbor appears as CSJ. And Peter HSM.

357
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,590
So derivative with respect to H is pulling down

358
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:46,090
both a beater and an M, so the batter comes out

359
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:52,060
and cancels that one over batter out front. So

360
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:54,760
we're just left with that. Whatever, Z.

361
00:25:56,990 --> 00:26:00,230
Some over the span configurations, which are the

362
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:08,670
microstates. Of the system. That magnetization of

363
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:12,750
each of those skin configurations and then the

364
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:17,880
exponential of the same factor as above, which is

365
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:22,110
just the negative expectation value of that

366
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:23,490
overall magnetization.

367
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,610
Which is the number of spin's times the man, the

368
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:34,320
normalized magnetization person, that is our

369
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:40,350
quarter parameter, which. We're looking at two of

370
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:42,180
the terms in this equation, we can.

371
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:52,640
Identify. That's expectation value as this one

372
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:58,250
over and data that the derivative of the Lord of

373
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:02,130
the partition function, which is. Just what we had

374
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:05,060
down there and plugging in that fact arised

375
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:10,620
Medfield partition function. Gives us the.

376
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:21,820
Synch overcaution with the factor of. Tuti in plus

377
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:25,810
H coming from the argument of the of the Coche.

378
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:32,660
Which depends on. On both the left and right hand

379
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:35,330
sides of this equation, one twenty four, there is

380
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:38,990
dependence on the expectation value of the

381
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:42,770
magnetization on both sides of that equation,

382
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:45,590
which. Becomes

383
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:51,920
annoying to solve know, expecting when a cash is

384
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:55,670
equal to one piece of its argument, but can be.

385
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:58,250
Analyzed

386
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:03,950
by considering it a self consistency condition and

387
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:08,780
simply plotting the the two sides of this equation

388
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:12,470
as two separate functions and looking for their

389
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:16,100
intersections, which is equivalent to to looking

390
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:20,690
for the roots of the difference between those two

391
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:21,440
factors.

392
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:26,630
So that's what's exactly what's done over the next

393
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:30,590
few pages. Just starting off with a reminder of of

394
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:36,020
what the tension looks like at the at the baseline

395
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:41,090
where the tension of zero is zero and

396
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:47,350
asymptotically in. The limit of. It's argument

397
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,160
going to.

398
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:53,320
Plus or minus infinity, the change approaches plus

399
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,130
or minus one.

400
00:28:56,580 --> 00:29:00,420
In the you know, the horizontal axis here is just

401
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:07,160
that expectation value of the magnetization. Which.

402
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:14,520
You might recall that in the easy model, this this

403
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:22,300
is bounded to be between minus one. And one, when

404
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:25,210
all of the spins are aligned in either of the two

405
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:29,090
orientations that they can have. And this is

406
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:32,390
consistent with the self-consistent condition that

407
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:36,320
the easing model in this Manfield approximation is

408
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:41,150
only consistently described when this solid green

409
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:45,200
curve of the Tange and the straight dotted line of

410
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:49,400
itself. So Y equals X when those intersect is the

411
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:53,330
only possible solution, possible description of

412
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:58,760
the easy model in this Manfield approximation,

413
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:02,360
which in this case the only intersection is right

414
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:07,840
here at the origin to the point zero zero. The

415
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:12,270
things become more interesting when. An external

416
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:17,370
magnetic field is turned on that simply shifts the

417
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:23,410
argument of this hyperbolic tangent. The magnetic

418
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:27,610
field is positive, the attention gets shifted to

419
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:31,550
the left. When it's negative, it gets shifted to

420
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:37,160
the right. And we now see that the there is, again,

421
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:41,660
only one possible self-consistent description of

422
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:44,090
the using model in this Medfield approximation in

423
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:47,810
each of these cases. One is the intersection up

424
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:51,920
here with the positive value. Of the the

425
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:53,380
magnetization.

426
00:30:56,630 --> 00:31:00,050
The other is the intersection down here with.

427
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:06,740
Negative value. Of the magnetization and in both

428
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:12,260
cases, because the tension is bounded by plus or

429
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:16,370
minus one a vertically and this dotted line is

430
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:23,440
just. The lion, the lion X equals Y, we know that

431
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:28,580
this point here. Is MS equals one?

432
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,670
The mechanization equal to its maximum value, and

433
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:40,160
we can see that. In both of these cases, the only

434
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:44,390
consistent result is correctly within the.

435
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:52,720
Allowable domain of values for the magnetization,

436
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,800
which is not a proof that the Medfield

437
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,350
approximation is is actually working for the

438
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,630
system, but at least a

439
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,600
place where it could have failed and could have

440
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:07,360
given a nonsensical result, but instead it

441
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:10,660
remained consistent with the constraints that are

442
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:13,960
built into the structure of the system.

443
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,460
But, of course, when we looked at the at the faces

444
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:27,100
of using model. We saw that they depended on the

445
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:30,280
temperature rather than this external magnetic

446
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:34,870
field, that for simplicity when doing the high and

447
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:37,440
low temperature approximations, we turned off the

448
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:41,230
magnetic field to not have to worry about it. So

449
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:47,530
moving on, we need to look at what happens when

450
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:53,280
when the temperature varies in the self-consistent,

451
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:57,930
the condition that we're looking at by. By

452
00:32:57,930 --> 00:33:00,770
flooding these curbs and finding their their

453
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:05,160
intersections. So this here this spot here is the

454
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,680
same as the one above just with a lower

455
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,540
temperature and.

456
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:15,360
We double check. You know what exactly the change

457
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:22,160
was, so the temperature up above was. For in order

458
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:26,090
to get the know convenient argument of the

459
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:29,840
hyperbolic tangent here, we have have this and

460
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:33,980
reduced it down to two, still keeping the nonzero

461
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:38,910
external magnetic field. And now the the

462
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:43,180
intersections have shifted much closer to those

463
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:45,220
maximum values, plus or minus one.

464
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:52,370
They the plot up here, I mentioned in the notes

465
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:56,720
that. This magnetization, was it plus or minus

466
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:59,780
point eight eight, so it's approaching the the

467
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:03,360
asymptotic low temperature limit where the the

468
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:08,080
magnetization of one is set by. There was to

469
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,870
degenerate ground states out of the two to the

470
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:14,500
power nd now possibly 10 to the power, three

471
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,120
hundred or ten of the power of three hundred

472
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:20,260
million possible states as the temperature gets

473
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:24,430
lower. Because the tension gets steeper, it

474
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:30,470
approaches. That ordered limit of. More and more

475
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:31,040
quickly.

476
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:38,340
Now confirming that.

477
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:44,260
The Medfield approximation at low temperatures is

478
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:49,030
giving us a system in its ordered phase, so that's

479
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:52,630
another good sanity check of this approximation,

480
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,590
that it is doing something reasonable and

481
00:34:56,770 --> 00:34:58,120
identifying at least

482
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:03,010
at least the asymptotic phases know we saw at the

483
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:09,100
intersection at at zero when that external field

484
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:13,210
was set to zero. We always have the hyperbolic

485
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:16,540
Tange going through zero and intersecting with the

486
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:22,150
dotted line at that point. And. Now, for these two

487
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:25,690
cases of the temperature of four and eight.

488
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:30,660
With zero external field that.

489
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:40,810
Disordered. Phase solution. So in. Equals zero

490
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:46,630
corresponding to the disordered phase. Becomes the

491
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:49,730
only possibility at those high temperatures, the

492
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,410
the dance becomes for the slope of the dance

493
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:58,180
around zero becomes so low that it takes hands too

494
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:03,040
long to approach and Salsinha take value of one.

495
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:05,920
By the time it gets up there, it's no longer in

496
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:11,660
the physical domain. Of the using model bounded by

497
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:16,970
that magnetization within plus and minus one per

498
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:20,420
normalized for the total number of spins.

499
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:24,790
So.

500
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:31,090
We are seeing. Good sanity checks at.

501
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:37,530
At high temperatures and at low temperatures, at

502
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:41,430
least in the case of a non-structural field, there

503
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:45,330
was only this one possible self-consistent

504
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:47,910
solution coming from the main field approximation

505
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:52,680
corresponding to the the ordered face value of the

506
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:53,610
magnetization.

507
00:36:57,430 --> 00:37:01,400
And of plus or minus one. When that field is

508
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:05,450
turned off and the temperature is low, there is

509
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:08,750
this interesting behavior that there are actually

510
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:11,150
three intersections

511
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:17,840
within the allowable or accessible domain.

512
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:26,090
For the easy model. One at the the disorder

513
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:30,110
magnetization were advantages and another at the

514
00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:36,150
two now degenerates. Ordered phase ground states

515
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:41,010
with with no external field to energetically

516
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:44,370
prefer one or the other spin orientation, we have,

517
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:48,090
as always, that equal balance between.

518
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:54,540
The two degenerate ground states that differ only

519
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:57,780
by reversing every single spin from spin up,

520
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:00,690
flipping the spin down and spin down spontaneously

521
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:02,370
flipping to two point up.

522
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:10,000
But a little bit of thought. Reveals that in the

523
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,560
slow temperature phase. The solution is zero, even

524
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:20,020
though it exists is an unstable solution and

525
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:24,250
unstable root of the difference between these two

526
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:31,380
curves, which. We can. Figure out just by looking

527
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:34,620
at graphs of this sort of thinking about them in

528
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:40,620
the appropriate way. So if we zoom in. To the

529
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:45,840
origin here, if the tablet responds to that zoom

530
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:51,540
and we think about what happens if we are not

531
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:55,800
exactly at that self-consistent point, that

532
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:59,760
happens to randomly fluctuate just a little bit

533
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:05,580
off of it. Then for this blue curve at this, the

534
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:08,430
lowest temperature case, the attention.

535
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:17,780
Is the blue curve, and it is larger than the

536
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:21,170
magnetization itself, which I'll just call X for

537
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:25,400
simplicity. So that is to say, X is too small.

538
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:34,940
For the system to be self-consistent. And

539
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:40,190
therefore, you know, any algorithm that we set up

540
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:44,000
to search for a root of the difference between

541
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,180
these functions would say that, well, if X is too

542
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:54,770
small, we need to look at. Larger values. Of

543
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:57,920
course, in order to recover self-consistent seat.

544
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:00,520
So.

545
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:08,500
The the set up, the structure of. This this plot

546
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:14,180
or this route finding routine. Is such that it

547
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:17,540
pushes the system or the system flows.

548
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:25,320
Two larger values of X, which take us up. To even

549
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,960
larger values of that hyperbolic tangent, which

550
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:32,520
are, in fact, even further away, even greater than

551
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:36,150
X actually increasing the the disagreement and the

552
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:42,010
violation of consistency. So we keep being pushed

553
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:44,800
even further to a larger, larger efforts to try to

554
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:50,830
regain this balance between the. The two curves

555
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,350
whose intersection we're trying to find and we

556
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:57,070
follow along this curve all the way until we reach

557
00:40:57,370 --> 00:41:03,250
its ordered phase intersection, which is the the

558
00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:09,910
stable route to the stable solution at these low

559
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:13,090
temperatures when these multiple intersections

560
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:18,700
exist. So another way of visualizing this is by

561
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:23,080
plotting the difference itself, again, against

562
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:27,220
that expectation value of the memorisation and

563
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:29,470
putting the arrows on here, just as we did above.

564
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:35,370
Seeing which way the system wants to flow, if it

565
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:40,380
happens to be displaced from one or another of

566
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:41,970
these routes where it vanishes.

567
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:47,200
Probably also something that can be seen by by

568
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:51,970
taking the the derivative and looking at where

569
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:55,930
that is minimize or maximize to identify the

570
00:41:56,170 --> 00:41:59,890
stable and unstable solutions or the minimal

571
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:03,370
maximum of that stability condition. But the

572
00:42:03,370 --> 00:42:06,700
conclusion is that this new approximation is not

573
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:10,210
only allowing for the possibility of an order

574
00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:14,230
phase at low temperature, but by having that being

575
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:18,730
the only. Stable solution, it is correctly

576
00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:20,320
identifying.

577
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:27,800
That there is a transition between the order phase

578
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,470
and the disorder phase as the temperature

579
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:34,390
increases going from order to low temperature to

580
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,720
disorder at high temperature, and by virtue of

581
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:42,140
having an exact analytic solution for the

582
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:45,200
partition function and for the expectation value

583
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:49,650
of the magnetization. In the form of this tension,

584
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:53,370
we can then from the bean field approximation, it

585
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:59,170
is simple enough to get an expression for the. The

586
00:42:59,170 --> 00:43:04,450
critical temperature at which. The stability of

587
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:08,650
this disordered phase route changes from being

588
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:10,900
stable at high temperatures to being unstable at

589
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:16,170
low temperatures, that happens exactly when. The

590
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:22,350
tension at the origin has the same slope as just

591
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:26,070
the expectation value Y equals X, which is to say

592
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:31,200
the the slope of the Tange has to equal one at

593
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:37,940
that critical temperature. And by expanding the

594
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:41,270
tension, a series approximation, we can take that

595
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:45,190
derivative to to define the slope,

596
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:52,370
it's the derivative and use that variable X again.

597
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:54,340
Just to.

598
00:43:57,010 --> 00:44:01,530
Reduce the amount that I need to write. Executed

599
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:09,980
at X equals zero, which is just. Well, the

600
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:15,180
argument to. PETA claims the dimensionality and

601
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:18,770
then. Doing the derivative brings down one of

602
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,560
those factors of X, so we only have.

603
00:44:23,690 --> 00:44:27,170
Something that depends on. The magnetization

604
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:30,140
squared as the next correction, but of course,

605
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:34,430
when we set that magnetization to zero to look at

606
00:44:34,430 --> 00:44:39,650
the slope in the the relevant intersection between

607
00:44:39,650 --> 00:44:42,920
these curves, then everything that depends on him

608
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:47,180
is going to drop out. And we have just two better

609
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:51,320
times of dimensionality equals one or that

610
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:56,030
critical beat up is whatever to the political

611
00:44:56,030 --> 00:44:58,970
temperature is just to D.

612
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:05,530
And that turns out to be wrong.

613
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:15,090
For for the actual interacting easing model, this

614
00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:17,880
is where we see the Medfield approximation

615
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:21,930
revealing itself to be just an approximation and

616
00:45:21,930 --> 00:45:26,610
not an exact solution of this interacting system

617
00:45:26,610 --> 00:45:29,460
in the in the two dimensional case where an exact

618
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:34,260
solution is possible. That exact solution predicts

619
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:41,220
this funny expression for the inverse critical

620
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:43,890
temperature being a sea of about zero point four

621
00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:49,250
for. Whereas, you know, our prediction of a

622
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:54,200
critical bit of one over two times two dimensions

623
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:58,310
is point to five is off by very nearly a factor of

624
00:45:58,310 --> 00:46:01,310
two. So it's the right order of magnitude. So

625
00:46:01,310 --> 00:46:05,600
qualitatively acceptable, but not not a very

626
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:09,680
reliable guide to that two dimensional case. Just

627
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,240
as a fun historical note,

628
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:16,250
this two dimensional critical temperature for the

629
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:20,630
easy model was actually determined exactly even

630
00:46:20,630 --> 00:46:23,480
before the easy model itself was solved

631
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:26,240
analytically by Einziger in the 1940s.

632
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:30,880
And that was done through a technique known as

633
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:35,230
developing by a couple of folks called Kramers and

634
00:46:35,230 --> 00:46:41,200
Vania. They were able to find that the. So Kramers

635
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:45,280
body found a relation between the behavior of the

636
00:46:45,290 --> 00:46:47,500
easy model in its high and low temperature,

637
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:50,140
Faison's something that's now it is called Kramers

638
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:55,210
finding a duality and by requiring that.

639
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:02,640
This is the this relation be satisfied in both the

640
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:05,490
high and low temperature phases at the same

641
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:08,860
temperature. That is the temperature at which both

642
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:11,260
the high and low temperature phases are

643
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:14,660
simultaneously valid. You can identify as the

644
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:19,450
critical temperature and solving the Kramers self

645
00:47:19,450 --> 00:47:23,900
to reality condition produces this. Funny, one

646
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:27,800
half of a log of one plus square root two, which

647
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:32,000
was then a consistency check that Oddsmaker was

648
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,570
able to derive from his exact solution of the

649
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:39,770
using model and in the zero field case. And just

650
00:47:39,770 --> 00:47:44,860
as the last note to. To wrap up today and wrap up

651
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:47,110
these synchronous sessions, the Medfield

652
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:49,510
approximation turns out to fail badly in

653
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:54,580
relatively low numbers of dimensions. The one

654
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:57,280
dimensional easy model does not show a transition

655
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:00,400
at all in contrast to the main field approximation.

656
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:04,180
But the meaningful approximation does become exact

657
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:07,390
in the sort of formal mathematical limit where

658
00:48:07,390 --> 00:48:11,230
each site has an infinite number of neighbors, or

659
00:48:11,530 --> 00:48:15,550
we have a simple cubic lattice in an infinite

660
00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:20,080
number of dimensions. And the. The qualitative or

661
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:23,650
conceptual reason for that is because in that case,

662
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:27,160
each site is interacting with a larger and larger

663
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:30,070
number of nearest neighbors forward and backward

664
00:48:30,070 --> 00:48:32,700
in every one of those dimensions.

665
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:39,340
It feels the overall adverse effects of a larger

666
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:43,420
and larger number of spins so that the the mean

667
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:46,330
value of the spin that goes into this effective

668
00:48:46,330 --> 00:48:50,350
magnetic field and windfield approximation becomes

669
00:48:50,350 --> 00:48:53,980
more and more like what each spin is seeing by

670
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:57,880
virtue of its interactions with more and more of

671
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:02,160
its neighbors. So that is.

672
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:10,250
Showing the know the limitations of approximations

673
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:13,190
that allow us to solve this interacting system

674
00:49:13,850 --> 00:49:17,630
approximately by making it not interacting in a

675
00:49:17,630 --> 00:49:20,210
clever or refined way in the.

676
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:24,850
The regime in which that approximation becomes

677
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:28,630
more or less reliable, working in a larger or

678
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:31,450
smaller number of dimensions, I'll wrap up there

679
00:49:31,450 --> 00:49:36,580
with my spiel for today. Shut down the recording

680
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:38,950
and back for the last round of scheduled office

681
00:49:38,950 --> 00:49:42,040
hours, though, at the individual office, hours can

682
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:44,290
still be booked by appointment through the

683
00:49:44,290 --> 00:49:47,980
assessment period. And with the end of this

684
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:52,470
recording to say, I hope you enjoyed. Some of the

685
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,920
statistical physics stuff we were able to to see

686
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:59,730
this term and good luck with that final assessment

687
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:01,410
in your preparations for it.
