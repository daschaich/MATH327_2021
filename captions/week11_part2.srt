00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,810
Hello and welcome back to statistical physics,

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:10,200
this is the second video for week 11, which may be

3
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:16,350
a shorter one since after wrapping up the previous

4
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,100
discussion of numerical computations through

5
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,340
Monte Carlo important sampling techniques, the

6
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:28,620
other sections in week 11 materials are shorter

7
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:35,040
and a bit more qualitative. And also outside the

8
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,310
mainstream of this module's materials, though. No

9
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:45,200
less important for all that, the goal here is to

10
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:49,750
take a step back, even beyond this miserable

11
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:55,070
itself, and consider and appreciate how the

12
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:58,400
statistical physics concepts and tools that we

13
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:03,860
have been learning about and working through find

14
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:06,770
very broad applicability throughout.

15
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:12,290
A whole range of areas of scientific investigation

16
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:16,710
in the mathematical sciences and beyond. Part of

17
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:22,990
the. Reason for the broad applicability of the

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,670
statistical physics tools is an important concept

19
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:31,630
related to phase transitions that is known as

20
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:37,810
universality, a bit too technical to get through

21
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:42,040
in in rigorous detail in the scope of this

22
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,580
molecule, but useful to to be aware of and have

23
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:52,110
some familiarity with. The basic idea is that. The

24
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:56,700
critical exponents of the sort that we saw for the

25
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:00,720
U.S. model last week that described the behavior

26
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,000
not only of the order parameters, but also other

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,810
observables in the vicinity of second order phase

28
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:11,370
transitions are close to critical points. The same

29
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:14,640
critical exponents historically were observed to

30
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,840
appear in different systems with phase transitions

31
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,750
that don't seem to have anything to do with each

32
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:25,020
other. And a famous example being this critical

33
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:29,150
exponent that I call B here. It's more widely

34
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:32,640
known as Beda, I don't want to get that confused

35
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,540
as the inverse temperature this be for the three

36
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:40,010
dimensional easing model is precisely the same as

37
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,360
a critical exponent that shows up if we consider

38
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:48,890
the phase transition between interacting a liquid

39
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:54,840
and gas phases of, say, water and steam. And in

40
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,870
particular, the independence of the inverse

41
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:01,740
density of those two phases around the critical

42
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:07,160
temperature. Exactly the same critical exponents

43
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,250
show up in both of those transitions and many

44
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:15,230
others, which is or was eventually understood to

45
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:20,270
be a reflection that at phase transitions the.

46
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:24,240
Details, the specifics of these statistical

47
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:28,950
systems cease to matter, they become irrelevant in

48
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:33,420
such a way that completely different systems like

49
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,650
interacting spins in a regular cubic lattice or

50
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:42,330
water boiling are governed by precisely the same

51
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:49,020
mathematics, the universality class into which the

52
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,450
critical exponents of the corresponding transition

53
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:59,040
happen to fall. And as a brief aside, for those

54
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,720
with philosophical interests, this universality

55
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:09,570
can be taken as at least a partial response to one

56
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:12,510
of the first footnotes that came up in the

57
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:19,350
materials for for the module where we mentioned

58
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:23,070
the famous essay on the unreasonable effectiveness

59
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:25,740
of mathematics in the natural sciences.

60
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:33,140
Universality can be used to argue why. The

61
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,780
effectiveness of mathematics is more reasonable

62
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:41,880
than it may seem. If all of these. Details become

63
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:47,850
irrelevant in critical systems, so that is

64
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:51,420
something to be aware of and another thing to be

65
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:55,850
aware of at a much less technical level are the

66
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,170
and the broader implications and the.

67
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:05,370
The wide variety of systems to which. Statistical

68
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:08,700
physics tools are applicable and the power that

69
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:15,240
that they have when used to analyze. Questions

70
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,390
ranging from not only physics and mathematics, but

71
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:20,910
all the way to the life sciences and even

72
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,810
sociology, so there are just three examples here

73
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:30,300
that aren't going to be worth summarizing in too

74
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,930
much detail in this video. But in the sociological

75
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:36,150
context, there is a.

76
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:41,660
Wide range of work being done actively on what are

77
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:44,990
called voter models that resemble in some ways.

78
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:49,790
The interacting spin systems that we saw in the

79
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:53,150
context of the easy model, but also describe the

80
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:58,760
outcomes of polls and elections where voters

81
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:02,390
opinions on particular questions or topics are

82
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:06,560
represented as integer spins, possibly with

83
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,370
generalizations to allow for neutrality or to

84
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:14,630
allow for people who are especially committed to

85
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:17,810
the opinion that they hold. And based on that

86
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:22,430
simple setup, all sorts of realistic behavior can

87
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:26,300
be observed. This figure here showing how.

88
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:31,980
Connections between groups with differing opinions

89
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,870
can evolve over time and can be used to modify the

90
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:40,110
opinions of those groups, where there are phase

91
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:44,250
transitions between phases where one opinion

92
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:48,750
becomes a consensus compared to other phases where

93
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:52,350
there are what are called stable, non consensus,

94
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:57,240
non consensus phases where multiple opinions

95
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:01,380
persist indefinitely among communities that to an

96
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:05,850
extent just stop talking to each other. They exist

97
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,750
to some extent in clusters. Or we might call

98
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:14,220
bubbles in a sociological context and speak mainly

99
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:18,930
with people who who share their same opinion with

100
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:21,510
fewer interactions with those holding the opposite

101
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:22,000
opinion.

102
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:27,640
So moving on to further examples, epidemiology,

103
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,700
the study of, for instance, the spread of disease

104
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:34,090
in a population is something we've probably all

105
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:40,240
seen over the past year and change where know

106
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:43,420
precisely statistical physics models of

107
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:47,650
interacting degrees of freedom can be used to

108
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:54,970
model how individuals move, contact and interact

109
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:58,840
with each other and thereby spread infections and

110
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:03,100
diseases through a population in between different

111
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:06,610
populations, as well as modeling the likely

112
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:10,240
effects of restrictions on people's movements,

113
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:15,790
like not holding lectures in person, but recording

114
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:18,460
these videos and having secret assume sessions.

115
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:24,870
And, you know, the the example shown here that you

116
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:31,620
can go and and run through this link is an

117
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:34,680
extremely simplified a simulation, but it is the

118
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:38,280
case that precisely these sorts of numerical

119
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:42,300
calculations based on models of interacting

120
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:49,660
particles, you know, not ideal gases for the an

121
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:52,080
important piece of input that goes into government

122
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,830
deliberations over what restrictions ought to be

123
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:58,650
imposed to control the spread of disease and how

124
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:03,990
long those restrictions need to remain in place.

125
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:08,940
And the final example is a phenomenon known

126
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,920
alternately as flocking or or swarming, which is

127
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:19,380
another biological application where various

128
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:24,090
species of animals from birds such as starlings to

129
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:27,600
schools of fish, swarms of insects or crowds of

130
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,710
people. Exhibit large scale coordinated behavior

131
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:38,050
as a result of of the interactions between the

132
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:42,070
individual members of those crowds. This being a

133
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:46,120
representative picture of a bunch of birds forming

134
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:48,040
distinct flocks that all

135
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:54,400
fly through the sky and turning and spinning about

136
00:09:54,400 --> 00:10:02,200
in. Surprising amount of unison just to to look at

137
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:06,030
them and that. That amount of unison, that

138
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:08,970
coordination between these flocks of many

139
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:13,380
interacting, degrees of freedom, many interacting

140
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:17,550
birds, turns out to be very well modeled by

141
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,950
interacting statistical physics systems. One

142
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:26,350
example known as the Big Six model, the big stick

143
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,540
was only one of about half a dozen researchers who

144
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:30,950
developed it in the 90s

145
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:37,040
simply introduces an interaction that encourages

146
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:41,570
these animals to align with the directions in

147
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:43,790
which their neighbors are moving in. Much the same

148
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:47,150
way that the interactions of the easy model

149
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:52,310
encourage it spins all to align. With each other

150
00:10:54,050 --> 00:11:00,080
and seeing in this bottle of flocking a phase

151
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:04,370
transition, in this case, a discontinuous first

152
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:07,160
order phase transition between two phases in which

153
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:12,230
the emotion of the animals is either random and

154
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:18,060
disordered or a. A high density ordered phase

155
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:22,980
where a collective motion sets in and yeah,

156
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,230
there's a bit more to read in the materials

157
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:30,700
themselves. But the idea is that these three

158
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,550
examples of broader applications beyond

159
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:37,780
mathematical sciences are far from exhaustive, but

160
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:42,130
give a flavor of the ways that the concepts and

161
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:46,270
tools we've been looking at this term find

162
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:51,010
application really throughout science research in

163
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:57,100
everyday life and with the understanding and

164
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:00,300
appreciation for these tools that that we now have,

165
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:03,760
you can stay on the lookout for further examples.

166
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,380
And I will wrap up there and not go through this

167
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:12,250
final section, which just summarizes and

168
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:17,350
synthesizes the information that we've seen in the

169
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:20,170
topics we've gone through in the previous 10 weeks

170
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:24,910
of doing a summary of a summary would be a bit of

171
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:29,530
overkill. This can serve as a quick reference

172
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:32,920
section while you're revising for the exam in a

173
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:37,600
few weeks just to check that you recall the topics

174
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,170
discussed in each week and provide quick links to

175
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:46,150
hop back and take another look at any that seem

176
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:53,620
unfamiliar or may require a bit of revision to

177
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:57,660
wrap up the. The term as a whole.
