00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:04,940
Hello and welcome back to Statistical Physics.

2
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:09,470
This is the second video for week 10 wrapping up.

3
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:13,280
That's a brief summary of the context, motivations

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,670
and key of learning outcomes for interacting

5
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:21,140
systems and in particular, doing so more briefly

6
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,810
than the first video for this week, which went

7
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:29,570
significantly over the target of time. So without

8
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:32,960
further ado, we'll just pick right back up where

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,750
we were in this week's materials, having

10
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:39,710
introduced the mathematical definition of phase

11
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:42,860
transition and how it is distinguished from a a

12
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:47,390
smooth, gradual crossover by the existence of a

13
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:52,280
discontinuity in either the order parameter itself

14
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,580
that distinguishes the different large scale

15
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:59,690
phases of the system. Or in derivatives of that

16
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:03,590
order parameter with respect to the control

17
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:06,080
parameters. So in the case, the easy model, the

18
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,250
order parameter is the magnetization. And the

19
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:13,640
control parameter is the temperature, and when we

20
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,270
have a discontinuity in the order parameter in

21
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:19,880
general, that is known as a first order phase

22
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,150
transition, and we will see in the last section

23
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:27,590
for this week that in two or more dimensions, the

24
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:30,560
easy model has been said, a second order phase

25
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,710
transition where the order parameter itself is

26
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:36,800
continuous, but it has a kink where its first

27
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:41,150
derivative is is discontinuous, where divergence.

28
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:48,230
And we will we will figure this out, we will

29
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:50,330
establish that result by considering an

30
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:53,570
approximation that will allow us to get some

31
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:58,370
results for this interactive system where by

32
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:00,800
virtue of those interactions, the calculation

33
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:04,610
immediately becomes enormously more difficult than

34
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:07,340
the non distracting spend system we considered

35
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:13,020
back in weeks, two and three. And the starting

36
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,520
point for this is.

37
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:21,010
Noticing that the order parameter or the

38
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:23,680
magnetization is related to the order parameter is

39
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,840
just the average spin over all of the degrees of

40
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,060
freedom in the system. And if we take the

41
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:36,690
expectation value of this, every spin, we will

42
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:42,870
have Mison, this mean magnetization is the origin

43
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,490
of the meaning in the so-called Medfield

44
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:47,280
approximation, though, you don't need to worry too

45
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,280
much about that terminology, which is largely

46
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:56,190
historical. But the approach, the the way this

47
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:59,910
Medfield approximation works is to right. That

48
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:03,390
interaction term involving two factors of spins on

49
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:08,160
nearest neighbor sites in terms of fluctuations

50
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,180
about this constant mean. And we make the

51
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:17,610
approximation that for a system with a sufficient

52
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:23,400
number of particles sufficiently large n the

53
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:27,490
average fluctuations about the mean and.

54
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:32,210
Magnetization are going to be small, at least when

55
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:35,720
we sum over all of the links, all of the nearest

56
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:42,020
neighbor pairs in the lattice in the sun that

57
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:45,590
appears in the energy. The individual terms may

58
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:48,170
not be small from site to site, but something over

59
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:52,910
all sites can reliably approximate this

60
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:57,020
interaction term by dropping the quadratic piece

61
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:00,500
of two factors of this small quantity and keeping

62
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:05,600
something that is only linear in the spins in both

63
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,660
of these terms and the sum over the links and the

64
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:12,890
sum over the sites which can then be combined into

65
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,180
this form where.

66
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,240
There is a constant factor in the energy that

67
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,170
doesn't affect any expectation values and then the

68
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,380
same sort of some overspends with an effective

69
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:32,870
magnetic field. That depends on this mean spin,

70
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:37,330
the average magnetization, which is another aspect

71
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:41,650
of being fields being involved in this calculation.

72
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,950
And I should mention here that we didn't have to

73
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:50,800
have a slight change in the design convention for

74
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,050
the external magnetic field in order to keep it

75
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:56,260
consistent with the magnetization defined in the

76
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:59,740
previous section. So sorry for having to change

77
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:03,610
that on the fly for that relative negative side is

78
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:06,010
going to be easy to keep track of in these

79
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:14,790
calculations and with the. Energy cast into this

80
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:19,740
approximate form involving this average, this

81
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:22,510
effective field, depending on the mean

82
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:26,220
magnetization, the calculation is very much like

83
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:29,730
what we did back in week three and we can get the

84
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:34,470
corresponding protection function in terms of the

85
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,470
average, the expectation value of the

86
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:42,350
magnetization. Which appears both in an overall

87
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:46,100
exponential factor as well as in the hyperbolic

88
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:49,520
cosine to the power in that should look familiar

89
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:51,620
from the non interacting case

90
00:05:54,140 --> 00:06:00,210
and. To get another handle on this expression, we

91
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:04,050
can take the usual derivative of the log of the

92
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:07,170
partition function so the derivative of the

93
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:10,740
elbow's free energy and considering just for a

94
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:14,490
moment, the fully using model with its interaction

95
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:19,110
restored, we can see that the total magnetization

96
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:23,460
sum over all and spin's appears in that energy

97
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:28,200
through its connection with the the average spin.

98
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,890
So taking the derivative of the Helmholtz free

99
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:34,890
energy with respect to that external magnetic

100
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:40,380
field. Gives us another relation between the

101
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:45,250
expectation value for the magnetization and the

102
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:49,200
the factors of that.

103
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:55,110
Expectation value that appear in the main field

104
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:59,700
partitioned function, and we end up with a still

105
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:03,360
non-trivial equation involving this expectation

106
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,210
value. Where because it appears on both sides, we

107
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:13,760
want to consider this as a condition of the

108
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,140
magnetization. That depending on the

109
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:20,110
dimensionality, these intercepts are data and

110
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:23,920
exterminate it feel each has to satisfy this

111
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:27,040
requirement in order to have a self-consistent

112
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:30,790
solution for the order parameter.

113
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,000
Now solving.

114
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:38,600
The self consistency condition is equivalent to

115
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:42,650
finding the roots of the difference between these

116
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:45,560
two functions. The expectation value that we're

117
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:51,220
after and this is hyperbolic tangent. And quick

118
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:56,010
and easy way to. To find those roots and see how

119
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:59,970
they behave is to look at the intersections of

120
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,490
these two functions on either side of the equals

121
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:07,290
sign plotted against the order parameter so that

122
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,860
that expectation value is just the constant

123
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:14,580
straight line with slope one. And this is how the

124
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:18,000
hyperbolic tangent looks, picking parameters so

125
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,920
that all the factors of BTD and age cancel out

126
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:26,790
here. And just in two dimensions for illustration.

127
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:31,810
And as we change the magnetic field H and the

128
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:35,950
inverse temperature beat up, of course, the

129
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:38,260
expectation value of M, the dotted line stays the

130
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:41,650
same, but the hyperbolic tangent gets shifted

131
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:46,310
around for different magnetic fields. Moving the

132
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:51,170
intersection from the point zero zero to non-zero

133
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:54,470
points in which the destines are all

134
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:57,320
preferentially aligning with that external

135
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:02,300
magnetic field, and if we decrease the temperature,

136
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:07,270
then. We see that the intersection moves even

137
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:10,720
closer to its limiting values out of one or minus

138
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,770
one, corresponding to the ordered phase discussed

139
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:18,160
in the previous video. I guess the most

140
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,740
interesting case is turning off that external

141
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:23,200
magnetic field and looking at a few different

142
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,960
temperatures from a low temperature and blue to a

143
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:29,680
high temperature in red, where the the low

144
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,840
temperature is the interesting one, because it has

145
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:35,500
three intersections with the expectation value of

146
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:40,660
the magnetization of the intersection at zero

147
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:45,730
magnetization. That could correspond to a

148
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:49,420
disordered phase, but also possible intersections

149
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:49,840
at

150
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:57,190
high and low values of the mechanisation. So some

151
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:02,710
plus or minus and not that. We could interpret as.

152
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:12,100
As a. Sign of an ordered phase developing

153
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,770
spontaneously, even in the absence of an external

154
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:16,680
magnetic field for

155
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:24,280
to guide the spin's alignment. And with just a

156
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,620
little reflection, we can see that in the low

157
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:28,810
temperature case with these three intersections,

158
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:34,750
the intersection at the point zero is unstable. If

159
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:41,950
we fluctuate just a little bit off of that point,

160
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,340
then looking here at the difference between those

161
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:48,580
two functions that we want to equal zero, we see

162
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:54,130
that when this difference is positive. That means

163
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:57,280
that's the magnetization which also appears on the

164
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:01,480
horizontal axis, is too small compared to the

165
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:05,500
hyperbolic tangent, and we want to push off to

166
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,860
higher values of the magnetization in order to

167
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,210
recover the.

168
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:15,730
The solution that we can identify with the ordered

169
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:19,740
phase, so just as we checked in the asymptotic

170
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:22,810
limits in the previous video, this Medfield

171
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:23,800
approximation.

172
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:29,990
Correctly predicts that at high temperatures, the

173
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:32,960
easy model is in a disordered phase, while at low

174
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:36,740
temperatures it is an ordered phase by considering

175
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:43,780
the slope of the hyperbolic tangent around. This

176
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:48,220
critical solution of mechanization equals zero,

177
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,300
you can determine the. The temperature at which

178
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:57,380
the zero solution becomes unstable and the ordered

179
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:01,010
phase solution develops and the question then is

180
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:05,270
whether or not there are any discontinuities at

181
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:09,010
that. At that temperature, which would make a true

182
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:12,390
critical temperature. So.

183
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,810
We can do this with one further approximation,

184
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:20,300
just truncating the expansion of the hyperbolic

185
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:25,100
tangent at Kubic Order, so dropping Firepower's.

186
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:30,360
And which is permissible when we consider values

187
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:35,910
of the temperature that are close to this TSI at

188
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:39,660
which the zero solution becomes unstable. But

189
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:40,170
still

190
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:46,310
still smaller than it so that the. As the value of

191
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:49,040
the magnetization is non-zero, but still very

192
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,760
small in the overall argument of the hyperbolic

193
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:58,200
tangents itself is therefore still. And a quick

194
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,610
calculation gives us.

195
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:05,570
An expression for the order parameter that depends

196
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:09,830
on the square root of the difference between the

197
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:14,740
temperature. And this this I'll start calling it

198
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:17,560
the critical temperature, see, because we can see

199
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:23,890
with a first derivative of this. Word parameter, a

200
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:28,150
quantity that diverges at the critical temperature

201
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,270
while the order parameter itself is continuous,

202
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:36,400
establishing a second order phase transition in

203
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,990
any number of dimensions.

204
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,950
Another interesting aspect of this prediction is

205
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:45,950
the the power dependence that shows up in the

206
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:49,340
order parameter of this factor of a half is known

207
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:53,060
as a critical exponent, which here the bean field

208
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:56,990
approximation predicts to be a half in again in

209
00:13:56,990 --> 00:14:00,110
any number of dimensions, whereas the critical

210
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:04,010
temperature itself depends on the dimensionality

211
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:07,280
of the lattice moving to higher and higher

212
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:11,720
temperatures as the. Number of dimensions

213
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,530
increases.

214
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:18,130
In one dimensions, this result is completely wrong,

215
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:24,040
using his work in his PhD thesis in the 1920s

216
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:27,640
found that in one dimensions there is no phase

217
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:32,250
transition at all. But in two dimensions on

218
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:35,340
Secours exact solution, establish that there is

219
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,920
indeed a second order phase transition with a

220
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,380
temperature that's about a factor of two different

221
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,570
from what the battlefield approximation predicts

222
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:47,010
and a critical exponent. That's all that we get

223
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:49,230
rolling through the minefield approximation by a

224
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:53,190
factor of four. And as we go to higher and higher

225
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:55,890
dimensions, the agreement becomes better and

226
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:59,580
better with, in fact, exact agreement for the

227
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:02,970
critical exponents in four or greater dimensions

228
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:04,800
and

229
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,240
in fact, an exact agreement for the full solution

230
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,510
itself in the forward limit of an infinite number

231
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:15,960
of dimensions where the the Medfield approximation

232
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:20,730
becomes exact qualitatively because each spin has

233
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:23,700
an infinite number of nearest neighbors that allow

234
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:27,720
it to exactly feel the the expectation value.

235
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:35,530
Of all of those nearest neighbor spin's. And

236
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:39,370
because there is no known exact solution in three

237
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:42,670
or higher dimensions, these this minefield

238
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:46,180
approximation has to be compared with numerical

239
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:50,240
calculations, which were mentioned briefly in the

240
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,160
previous video.

241
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,680
Where I noted that a brute force solution with the

242
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,110
computer would take far longer than the age of the

243
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:03,560
universe. So next week is as part of a broader

244
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:07,280
application. We'll see some tricks that will allow

245
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,550
quite accurate results for critical temperatures

246
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:14,600
and critical exponents to be computed in a

247
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,580
reasonable amount of time.
