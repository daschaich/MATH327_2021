00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:04,560
Hello and welcome back to the end of week two of

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,220
statistical physics, this is the wrap up video

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,250
that we'll spend roughly 10 minutes summarizing

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:15,220
the highlights and key learning outcomes, the

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:20,310
micro canonical ensemble. This is the first of the

6
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:23,130
three statistical ensembles we're going to be

7
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:27,120
focusing on throughout this module. And of those

8
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,210
three, the micro canonical is arguably both the

9
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:35,760
most fundamental and least useful. So recalling

10
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,980
that statistical ensembles are what we get when we

11
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:44,670
allow a system with a large number of particles or

12
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:48,300
10 to the power twenty three or more to evolve in

13
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:53,460
time with certain constraints imposed and

14
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,670
depending on what constraints are imposed, we end

15
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:59,460
up with different statistical ensembles. And in

16
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,350
the case of the micro canonical ensemble, the

17
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:04,440
constraints are conservation of energy and

18
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,650
conservation of particle number or the number of

19
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,650
degrees of freedom. And that is, I call that the

20
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,350
most fundamental because conservation of energy we

21
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:19,080
now know is a truly fundamental and generic

22
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,490
feature of physics resulting from a nervous

23
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:27,450
theorem. And when statistical physics was first

24
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:30,090
being developed in the eighteen hundreds, this was

25
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,480
not yet well understood and conservation of energy

26
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:37,380
became known under the more grandiose title of the

27
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:41,340
first law of thermodynamics. On the other hand,

28
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,840
having the energy of a particular system be

29
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,040
conserved has the implication that this system has

30
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,950
to be completely isolated from the rest of the

31
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,990
universe, which is the sense in which the micro

32
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:58,140
canonical ensemble is the least useful of the

33
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,710
three? Because that sort of complete isolation in

34
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:04,890
practice is not possible. And it's not the

35
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,200
conditions that we're interested in when we think

36
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,490
of doing observations or experiments on physical

37
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:15,030
systems, which necessarily imply some exchange of

38
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:18,330
energy between us, the observers and the system.

39
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,070
Despite that, because of the foundation and

40
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:25,140
conservation of energy, the micro canonical

41
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:29,490
ensemble is the best starting point and a good

42
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:33,810
place to develop some of the key concepts of

43
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:36,360
statistical ensembles more generally, the first of

44
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,240
which being the concept of thermodynamic

45
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,810
equilibrium, which is extremely important and will

46
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:48,330
be the condition that we focus on throughout this.

47
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,710
This module, non equilibrium, statistical

48
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:55,770
mechanics and not equilibrium thermodynamics is

49
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:58,590
extremely interesting, but also extremely

50
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,960
difficult and complicated. You have to do a lot

51
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,860
more mathematical work in order to say in order to

52
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,770
make a lot significantly weaker statements about

53
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,770
non equilibrium behavior of statistical systems.

54
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:17,370
So the thermodynamic equilibrium is to some extent

55
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:21,780
a simplifying assumption, but it also is a rich

56
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,260
field in its own right, as it describes sort of

57
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,820
the everyday conditions we're familiar with, where

58
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:33,150
the systems are existing in a fairly steady,

59
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:36,900
fairly stable state of being. I've tried to avoid

60
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,490
using the state there because I don't want to

61
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:43,350
confuse the condition of thermodynamic equilibrium

62
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:46,470
with the concept of microstates that describe the

63
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,920
distribution and characteristics of all the

64
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,730
microscopic degrees of freedom within the overall

65
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,200
large scale system. Anyway, looking at

66
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,630
thermodynamic equilibrium. This week we saw two

67
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:03,960
different ways of defining it. The first of which

68
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:07,470
is specific to the micro canonical ensemble and

69
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:11,010
states that thermodynamic equilibrium corresponds

70
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:14,730
to every possible micro state having the same

71
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:18,660
probability. And this may be surprising because it

72
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,060
means that, again, going back to the example of

73
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:25,020
the air in this room, if I consider a micro state

74
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:28,740
in which all of this er happens to be often that

75
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:32,880
quarter to my right, that particular micro state

76
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:37,530
is just as probable as the microstates I'm

77
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:40,440
currently in or the air is evenly distributed and

78
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,680
I'm not gasping for breath. And the reason that we

79
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:47,520
don't expect all of the air to be off in that

80
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,540
corner is because there are many more micro states

81
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:55,080
with a fairly even distribution of the molecules

82
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:58,590
compared to the number of microstates with that

83
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:02,290
more specialized. More surprising large scale

84
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:07,810
configuration of the system, and this brings us to

85
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,380
the concept of entropy. The first derived quantity

86
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,840
that we looked at in the micro canonical ensemble

87
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,500
and essentially in thermodynamic equilibrium,

88
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:24,010
entropy amounts to the logarithm of the number of

89
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:27,070
microstates, which means that the more microstates

90
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:31,570
there are, the the larger the entropy is. And I

91
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:35,020
should add as an aside here, that the number of

92
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:39,790
microstates is an extraordinarily large number for

93
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,640
statistical systems. We've been talking about the

94
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:46,380
ten to the power. Twenty three degrees of freedom

95
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:49,840
or particles in these systems. The different ways

96
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,150
that those ten of the power twenty three molecules

97
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:55,600
can be arranged typically gives rise to something

98
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,450
more like ten to the power, ten to the power,

99
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:01,870
twenty three microstates. So that even taking the

100
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:04,270
logarithm of that quantity, we still have an

101
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:07,840
enormous entropy of order. Avogadro's number.

102
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:14,920
Now, one property of entropy is similar to energy

103
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:18,490
and particle number is extensively the statement

104
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:23,860
that all of these quantities tend to grow as the

105
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:26,350
size of the system grows. This is sort of

106
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,830
tautological almost in the number of degrees of

107
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:33,580
freedom. And as each of those degrees of freedom

108
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:36,400
typically has a constant amount of energy

109
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,740
contributing to the total. It's also clear to see

110
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,810
that the energy increases.

111
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:49,300
We saw two different ways in which the entropy can

112
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:53,260
increase when considering larger systems. If the

113
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:56,260
larger overall system is made up of some systems

114
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,600
that are isolated from each other than the

115
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:02,170
entropies of those isolated subsystems, simply add

116
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,170
just the same way that the particle number or the

117
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:08,500
energies add. Something more interesting happens

118
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:11,470
if those two subsystems are brought together and

119
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:15,340
allowed to exchange energy between themselves. So

120
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:18,130
each subsystem is no longer governed by the

121
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:21,250
microeconomic ensemble. But the overall collection

122
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:24,220
of both of them still is the overall. Some of

123
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:29,620
their energies is still conserved. But because the

124
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:32,920
subsystems can now exchange energy, there are more

125
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,680
possible microstates that this micro canonical

126
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,610
system can adopt, which implies a larger entropy,

127
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,370
which is a form of the second law of

128
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:45,730
thermodynamics, that if we start off with isolated

129
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:48,130
systems and bring them together, we see that the

130
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:52,780
entropy generically increases. There is a formal

131
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:56,260
possibility that it may stay constant, but that

132
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:59,370
only happens in extremely special circumstances.

133
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:02,590
And so the formal statement is that the entropy

134
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:06,610
never decreases as isolated subsystems are brought

135
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:10,120
together and allowed to exchange energy. And by

136
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,630
doing some more extensive work that we're omitting

137
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:17,110
in this molecule, in this module, it can be

138
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:21,040
established that generically the entropy never

139
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:25,120
decreases as time passes, no matter what sort of.

140
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,860
Situations you consider so long as those occur in

141
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:37,200
the context of an isolated system that is that

142
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,170
doesn't have the opportunity to sort of hide

143
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:44,850
entropy in its surroundings in any way. So a key

144
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:47,570
takeaway there is the second law of thermodynamics.

145
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:52,260
The entropy never decreases and generically

146
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:57,390
increases. This allows us to introduce a more

147
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:01,380
generic definition of thermodynamic equilibrium,

148
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,230
which is that this is the thermodynamic

149
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:08,310
equilibrium corresponds to maximal entropy

150
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:16,680
from which if we then maximize our expression for

151
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:22,740
the entropy, we can derive our previous definition

152
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,920
of thermodynamic equilibrium in terms of equal

153
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,790
probabilities by using a Legrand's multiplier,

154
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:33,750
imposing the condition that the sum of the

155
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:36,270
probabilities of all microstates have to always

156
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:39,000
add to one part of our definition of probability

157
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,810
last week, and that LeoGrande multiplier trick is

158
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:46,050
going to pop up a few more times later in this

159
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:50,040
module, which is why I mentioned it here. Wrapping

160
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,860
up the last topic we looked at was the temperature,

161
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:56,730
which in the micro canonical context is also a

162
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:59,820
derived quantity rather than something fundamental.

163
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:03,990
So we proceeded by stating the formal definition

164
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:07,800
of the temperature and then showing that it

165
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,280
produces sensible results that we would expect

166
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,650
from everyday experience. And that formal

167
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:16,980
definition looks at how much the entropy can

168
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:20,940
change if the energy of the system were to change

169
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:23,940
with a fixed number of degrees of freedom. So that

170
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:29,160
partial derivative change in entropy as a result

171
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,770
of change in energy is actually the inverse

172
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:35,910
temperature, which we can try to intuitively

173
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:38,460
understand by thinking about some special cases

174
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:42,630
when we have. Well, we see later on with the

175
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:46,080
example of the spin system that the the minimal

176
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:49,920
temperature, which is non-zero, corresponds to the

177
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,780
single minimum energy state, so that adding a bit

178
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,540
of energy can have a relatively large effect

179
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:00,300
because there are relatively few microstates to

180
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:03,150
start off with. And adding that same bit of energy,

181
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:06,030
if we were approaching the infinite temperature

182
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:09,270
limit with an equal number of up and down spins

183
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:13,800
would have a much smaller effect. So one over tea

184
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,520
being much smaller corresponds to a larger t a

185
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:21,420
larger temperature in a self-consistent way. So

186
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:25,290
that's the qualitative view, how to understand

187
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:29,970
that partial derivative and using that spin system,

188
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:35,940
we went through a fairly detailed calculation that

189
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:40,860
started its life as a tutorial exercise to find

190
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:44,550
that the temperature in the limit of a large

191
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,770
number of particles, which is the generic

192
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:49,440
conditions we're always considering, is

193
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,750
approximately negative. In times H squared over E

194
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,060
or H is the strength of that external magnetic

195
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:00,000
field that introduces the temperature to the spin

196
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,780
system. So this is unusual in that we could have

197
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:07,110
negative temperatures. The temperature can diverge

198
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:11,550
when there are an equal balance number of spins

199
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:14,190
aligned and anti aligned with the magnetic field.

200
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:17,880
And there's also a non-zero minimum temperature.

201
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:21,350
The temperature for the spin system cannot be zero.

202
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:26,220
Some of those strange results are due to working

203
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,320
with the spin system. Some are due to working in

204
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,020
the micro canonical ensemble. But there are still

205
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:34,410
other results that agree with what we would expect.

206
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:36,990
First of all, we see that the temperature is an

207
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:41,010
intrinsic quantity rather than a sorry, an

208
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:44,320
intensive quantity rather than extensive quantity.

209
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:48,600
I misspoke earlier. So if we imagine devising a

210
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,680
system into isolated subsystems, those subsystems

211
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,590
have the same temperature as the original system.

212
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,500
The temperature is independent of the size of the

213
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:05,820
system. We also computed heat exchange for a

214
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:06,450
similar.

215
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:12,770
Thought experiment of taking two systems, putting

216
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:15,530
them in thermal contact and then isolating them,

217
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:19,500
finding with some assumptions about the the

218
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,570
entropy being continuous and differentiable, you

219
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,100
were able to expand the entropy in a Taylor series

220
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:28,790
and find that heat always flows. Or I should say

221
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:32,480
energy always flows from the hotter system to the

222
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:37,070
colder system of bringing their their temperatures

223
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:41,330
closer together. This is, of course, what we would

224
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:45,380
expect. And we will revisit this energy flow in

225
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:47,900
more detail later on in the module where we

226
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:51,590
formally introduced the definition of heat. For

227
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:55,040
now, though, we are going to build on that example

228
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,340
to in the coming week to find the canonical

229
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:04,130
ensemble where the temperature is the the

230
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:09,050
constrained quantity as opposed to the energy. So

231
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:09,650
let me

232
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:16,160
leave you there with that brief look ahead.
