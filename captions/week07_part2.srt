00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:05,240
Hello and welcome back to Statistical Physics.

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:10,040
This is the second video for week seven going over

3
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:15,800
quantum statistics and restarting the screen share

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:20,360
to take a look at the material for this week. Just

5
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:24,320
checking by recalling that in the first video we.

6
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:30,770
Reviewed the or summarized the fundamental

7
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:33,860
distinction between quantum and non, quantum or

8
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:39,140
classical statistics, which is the approach that

9
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:42,590
we take to defining the microstates over which we

10
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:46,130
have to sum to compute the partition function or

11
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:49,370
grant canonical partition function that defines

12
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:53,090
the systems we work with. And in the quantum case,

13
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:57,350
the sum over microstates has to take the form of a

14
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:02,020
sum over the quantize energy levels. In each

15
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:05,860
energy level, considering all possible occupation

16
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:08,530
numbers, the number of particles that energy level

17
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:14,380
could have. And this contrasts with the classical

18
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:17,950
treatments of systems with discrete quantize

19
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:21,010
energy levels, that classical treatment where we

20
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:24,070
sum over each particle and consider all of the

21
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:26,290
possible energies that could have leading to

22
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,930
overcounting that can become tricky to correct.

23
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:34,960
That produces a form of statistics that is known

24
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,840
as maximal Boltzmann's statistics. And in the

25
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,030
quantum case of something over energy levels and

26
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:43,000
occupation numbers, there are two different

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,090
possible versions of quantum statistics, depending

28
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:46,510
on.

29
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:51,560
Depending on whether those particles are bosons or

30
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,500
fermions, which differ in terms of the possible

31
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,590
occupation numbers that they have, so in Section

32
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:00,170
seven point three and seven point four, we go

33
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:03,660
through the quick computation of the grand

34
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,340
canonical partition function for generic bosun's,

35
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:11,210
first giving rise to those Einstein statistics and

36
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:15,230
then for generic fermions for it's a very similar

37
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:19,880
calculation as advertised. We sum over each energy

38
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,910
level and consider all the possible occupation

39
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:26,330
numbers where for boatswain's, if we consider the

40
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:29,570
simple case of a single energy level, then all we

41
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:32,390
have is the sum over occupation numbers from zero

42
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:34,580
to infinity, which gives a straightforward

43
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:38,780
geometric series. So long as the chemical

44
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:42,080
potential is small enough for this series to

45
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,560
converge. And physically it has to be to keep the

46
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:50,540
of the Grand Canyon a potential from from

47
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:54,770
diverging. There are no infinities in any physical

48
00:02:54,770 --> 00:03:00,110
systems. And because we're only considering ideal

49
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:02,540
gases or ideal systems of not interacting

50
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:05,600
particles, the generalization from a single energy

51
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,140
level to many energy levels is is very

52
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:13,420
straightforward. The total political number and

53
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:16,570
the total energy of the microstates, it's just a

54
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:20,620
linear sum over the occupation numbers in the

55
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:25,420
overall sum of sums over occupation numbers for

56
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:28,900
each energy level, zero energy level one all the

57
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,410
way up to the the last energy level. There could

58
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:35,050
be infinitely many energy levels so long as they

59
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:39,640
are accountable. All of those sums factories into.

60
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:43,130
The combination down here, so.

61
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:49,210
The generalised bilston factor breaks up into a

62
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:53,410
product of factors for his energy level, we can

63
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:56,380
rearrange those into sums for his energy level,

64
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:59,830
compute them all independently and end up with

65
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:04,360
just a simple product. We can also get that same

66
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,600
sort of behavior from the Maxwell Boltzmann grand

67
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,480
canonical partition function that was computer

68
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:13,390
back in seven point one, taking the classical

69
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:16,690
approach to a system with quantized energy levels.

70
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,160
And we can see the things looked relatively

71
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,750
different, there's an exponential of an

72
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:25,560
exponential in the next lobotomy case, classical

73
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,070
physics of the Bose Einstein case is the product

74
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:33,990
over these factors of one minus the exponential.

75
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,900
The case for fermions that gives rise to Firmage

76
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:43,280
Iraq statistics. Is is different itself, though,

77
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,070
the calculation is essentially identical to the

78
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:50,920
Bose Einstein one where. The sun's over energy

79
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,200
levels now have only two possible occupation

80
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,920
numbers, zero and one in each case, we can

81
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:01,210
redistribute the generalized bolson factor amongst

82
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:04,780
all those sums and end up with just the product of

83
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,350
this one, plus the exponential factor.

84
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:15,920
Almost the inverse of the Hoseason case with a

85
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,190
different side between the constants and the

86
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:22,580
exponential, which turns out to be a highly

87
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:27,990
significant, at least in. A certain regime where

88
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:30,930
quantum effects are significant.

89
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:37,110
But as mentioned in the previous video, as well as

90
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:42,060
in the material. In some regimes, we expect the

91
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:45,460
quantum approach to provide a very accurate

92
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:49,210
approximation to the true quantum behavior, which

93
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:52,840
is the reason that we observe classical physics

94
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,840
and in everyday phenomenon, even though they arise

95
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,500
from quantum physics at a more fundamental

96
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:05,050
underlying level. And a brief consideration of the

97
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:08,890
exercise we went through in week three, looking at

98
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:11,530
the high and low temperature limits of spin

99
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:15,280
systems with quantize energy levels, leads us to

100
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,050
recognize that the limit in which quantum physics

101
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:23,710
should reduce to the classical behavior is exactly

102
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:28,180
the high temperature limit. However, there is some

103
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,580
subtlety to considering the high temperature

104
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:33,490
limits in the grand finale ensemble, where the

105
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:36,790
particle number can fluctuate. And it turns out in

106
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:39,700
the calculation that we go through in this final

107
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:44,470
Section seven point five, that the particle number

108
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:50,050
starts to diverge, become infinite if we take the

109
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:53,050
temperature to infinity to a very high temperature

110
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:55,780
limit while keeping everything else fixed.

111
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:02,880
And we see that by going through the the exercise

112
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,520
of computing, the average particle number using

113
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,790
the basics, the fundamentals for the grand

114
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:13,370
economical ensemble that we developed in week six

115
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:16,310
before the break, writing down the Grand Chronicle

116
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:20,900
petition functions computer to both. Determining

117
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:25,380
the corresponding. Grant canonical potentials and

118
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:30,760
from them the average particle numbers, which in

119
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,430
all three cases of classical Maxwell Bowsman

120
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,850
statistics, those Einstein statistics for quantum

121
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:40,090
bosons and Fermi, direct statistics for quantum

122
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:45,470
fermions, we end up with a sum. Over the average

123
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:52,400
occupation numbers for each energy level where the

124
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:56,870
form of the average occupation number in the three

125
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,810
cases classical case, the Bozena case and the

126
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:04,780
Fermoy on a case are. Similar enough that we can

127
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:08,980
see they all reduced to each other when these

128
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:11,590
constants plus minus one factors in the quantum

129
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:14,440
case are negligible compared to the exponential

130
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:18,790
factors. So this very large exponential factor

131
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:22,990
corresponds to a very large argument for the

132
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:28,210
exponent, this energy level minus chemical

133
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:31,180
potential or the, I should say, the energy of the

134
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:34,390
energy level, minus the chemical potential divided

135
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:38,380
by the temperature very large, which is not what

136
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:40,930
we might have expected for a high temperature

137
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:45,220
limit. When the temperature gets large with

138
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:50,710
everything else fixed, this ratio naively goes to

139
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:54,160
zero rather than a very large number. And we can

140
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,880
see that the average occupation numbers then

141
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:01,090
become very large, especially in the business case

142
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:04,300
for the occupation number actually goes to

143
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:07,840
infinity thanks to that pesky negative sign in the

144
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:11,560
denominator as the exponential factor approaches

145
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:16,410
one. And this argument approaches zero, and this

146
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:19,610
is exactly where we expect the greatest

147
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:22,530
disagreements between classical and quantum

148
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:26,700
statistics. There's a very high probability that

149
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,150
multiple particles are occupying the same energy

150
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:34,230
levels, which was what led to the breakdown of the

151
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:38,340
classical approach we took earlier in the cure

152
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:43,050
that we have to impose is recognizing, as we said

153
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:46,650
earlier, that the high temperatures lead to very

154
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:50,010
large numbers of particles of infinite numbers of

155
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:52,440
particles if there are an infinite number of

156
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:57,100
energy levels. And in order to retain a finite

157
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:01,210
number of particles, that is what we have in any

158
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:04,720
physically, physically existing system, it is

159
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,840
finite. In order to keep the particle no finite,

160
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:11,290
we have to adjust the chemical potential new at

161
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:14,560
the same time as we adjust the temperature t and

162
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,770
in particular, the chemical potential has to go to

163
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:21,970
very large negative numbers faster than the

164
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:25,570
temperature goes to very large positive numbers or

165
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:31,480
in mathematical terms, the chemical the negative

166
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,750
chemical potential has to be much larger than the

167
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:38,200
temperature, even as the temperature becomes much

168
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,990
larger than one in the high temperature limit. So

169
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:43,780
this is the true high temperature limit where we

170
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:49,720
should expect quantum and classical physics to to

171
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,120
agree, to predict, to make the same predictions.

172
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:55,990
And the example of this is shown in this figure.

173
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,390
Which is not quite fitting on the screen,

174
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,750
this figure showing. Precisely that average

175
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:12,010
occupation number for the three cases of classical

176
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:14,770
maximum bolstered statistics, the Bose Einstein

177
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:18,310
statistics of bosons in the very direct statistics

178
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:23,260
of fermions as a function of that argument of the

179
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:26,440
multifactor energy minus chemical potential

180
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,710
divided by tea here with the irrelevant unit

181
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:32,890
conversion factor. So the high temperature limit,

182
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:36,610
where negative view is much larger than both the

183
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:40,630
energy and the temperature t corresponds to the

184
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:46,210
right side of this plot where we see all of the

185
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:50,590
classical and quantum predictions. Coming together

186
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,280
exponentially, quickly, so that they cannot be

187
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:58,930
distinguished by even when this ratio is only a

188
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:03,040
factor of a few in the opposite limits of low

189
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,790
temperatures is where we see dramatically

190
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:09,790
different behavior, both for the classical case,

191
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:15,100
which smoothly increases exponentially as the the

192
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,690
temperature decreases as that

193
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:21,910
as a combination of temperature and chemical

194
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:24,700
potential decreases to define the the low

195
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,910
temperature regime. You mentioned above that the

196
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:31,960
average occupation number for those Einstein

197
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:35,740
statistics actually diverges as this ratio

198
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:39,640
approaches zero, as the energy approaches the

199
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:43,000
chemical potential, whereas the very different

200
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:47,470
accesses can only interpolate between zero and one,

201
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:52,390
syntactically reflecting the rule for fermions

202
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:58,000
that at most one odd can be in any energy level.

203
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:05,190
So this low temperature quantum regime where those

204
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:09,480
odds and fermions behave much differently from

205
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,840
each other as well as from classical expectations,

206
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:16,290
is what we will dig into over the next couple of

207
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:16,740
weeks.
